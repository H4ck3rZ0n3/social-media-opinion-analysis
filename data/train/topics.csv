On my perspective, I think that the face is a natural landform because I dont think that there is any life on Mars. In these next few paragraphs, I'll be talking about how I think that is is a natural landform 
"With so many things in this world that few people agree on, this is a nice change to see in regards the removal of so many cars. Why would they all agree, one might ask. Well, there are plenty of reasons. 
"
No because, why should a computer know how your feeling? 
I think that it wouldn't be valueable to have technology be able to read emotions 
"Well, some people believe that it was something made by aliens. I am here to prove that it was not. 
"
summer projects should be teacher-designed 
In the following paragraphs they will talk about if we should or should not read students faces to make the classroom experience more enjoyable. 
"In conclusion the ""face'' to me is still just a land form. "
There are many sides to people giving up their cars. Some people are truly happy and some are not. It may not be that bad, i mean how did people manige before cars were even invented 
Limiting our usage of any type of motorized vehicle, would not only decrease air pollution but it would also help with adults or children that may not exercise enough.� 
So, no I don't think it's classroom valuable to use FACS. 
To improve student input schools should move towards student designed projects so students will be more intrested and and involved in the project. 
this new technology is valuable. 
If teachers gave students the opportunity to discover their own work, and maybe even a passion, students work would be of a higher quality and it might actually have them excited to go back to school. 
"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", it tals about how scientest are working on new technology to overcome the chalanges of Venus and its complications. "
Students shouldn't have to participate in one extracurricular activity or any 
You have to try this out

There is a lot of young teenagers and also adults getting into car accidents. Its because of our cellular devices, texting while driving. 
Yes, the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable 
I believe the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of a student in a classroom is valuable. 
The author of the article is right about the exploration of Venus being a worthy pursuit. 
The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom could be valuable, or it could be a waste of time, depending on how you look at it. 
scientist are till working on the planert wonderingthe same question as you why are we still working on this dangerus planet 
There are many limiting car usage, through out the world, 
I agree that it should be mandatory for all students to�participate in at least one extracurricular activity 
My claim to do studying on Venus is saying no I think spending so much time and money on something that has been tempted to do multiple times and failed is wasteful.

"The challeange of exploring venus

Study venus is a pursuit to dangers, Venus is the challenging planet to humans because of the diffculties. "
The author couldn't be any better in this story on why even with it's dangers we on earth should venture out and see what Venus is all about. Giving us multiplie reasons why we need to find a way to get someone (or something) over there as soon as possible 
The new technology used to undertstand facial expressions would be a valuable thing in a classroom 
I agree with Dr. Hung that the software would be useful to help decipher mixed emoitions.

There once was three citizen friends from boston who wanted who wanted to limit car usage to 70 percent they realized it was a good idea 
Schools should make it a requirement for all students participate in a extracurricular activity 
The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable 
The best way to ensure that students continue learning over break is to assign teacher-designed projects. 
Emplimenting a computer system in schools that is capable of reading a students emotions is inappropriate, lazy, and dangerous. 
"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggest that studing venus is worth while even though their are extreme dangers while doing it. "
These projects that get assign should be more student-designed 
Here's why students should be allowed to come up with their own school project to make sure they continue learning over summer. 
Summer projects should be teacher-designed 
. I don't agree that students should be forced to take one extracurricular activity, 
But as you can see in the pictures it's just a messa, a natural cause in nature, something that happens on earth, but it just so happened to look so much like a face from the possible clouds and blurry picture from the first 
Phone usage while driving should be prohibited in every state, country and continent! 
I think you should join too 
I would agree to computers that can identify humans emotions would be pretty cool for our inverment. 
I think that students should do at least one extracurricular activity. 
the author article about studying venus is good. My opnion is that we should study Venus because that can be a good thing for us 
There is nothing the Facial Action Coding could do for people in the world if you ask me. 
Every teacher should use this in their class room because the teacher could see what each student is feeling inside 
Disagree 
I would join this program because I can help people in needs and I could travel and see things that I wanted to see a long time ago I could travel all around the world all day every day of the week. 
The implementation of technology able to read the emotional expressions of children in the classroom is valuable for both the teachers and the students. 
"The ""Facial Action Coding System"" is technology that can be used in the class room because some people can't figure out how good or bad someone is feeling. "
This negatively affects teens and their society, and should be strictly avoided.

"
That the author did good job at explan the evidences like he saws, 
"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it may present. The author then goes on to tell us all of his facts that back up his claim "

it should be student-designed 
Schools must be aware that if summer projects are always going to be required, the assignments should be student-designed 
In a new modern classroom setting, students should have the liberty to design their own summer projects 
"Join the Seagoing Cowboys program so you can help people in need!

We think that you would be perfect for the program! Here are some reasons why you should join! 
"
The principal's idea of all students participating in at least one extracurricular activity is a bad idea 
I think Luke's point of view of convincing people to go on a Seagoing Cowboy trip. 
I agree with the claim against the value of using this technology to read student's emotional expressions.

I do not belive it is true. I will believe it when I see it. 
"so when it comes to the question ""should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed"" teacher-designed projects reign supreme, as it benefits both the student and the teacher in multiple different ways. 
"
I feel like I am for the value of this use of technology, because you can calculate other peoples facial emotions and your facial movements. 
Venus is a worthy pursuit because the more we know about our sister planet the more things we get to do with it. 
The face is a natral land form 
this software is a very good idea, for the teachers and the students too.

Limiting car usage is a discrase 
"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"",The author suggests that studying Venus is worthy pursuit depite the danger to humans, the personal risks and approaching it presents. 
"
I strongly disagree with the decision of my principal on this matter 
summer projects�should be teacher-designed 
being a Seagoing Cowboy would be a fun job to do 
This story about Venus talks about how NASA wants to study the planet. 
"To coincide with the theme of change and growth summer promotes, students should have the ability to choose their own projects, to further their educational experience and mental development, without the influence of a teacher.

Yes I agree that Venus is dangerous place, but scientists are trying to find ways to dicover and learn more about Venus. 
Scientists believed the face was an alien artifact . It actually was not.

Although, cars are used very often and are a useful form of transportation, they are also very hamful. Taking a break from driving isn't a bad idea.

As a response to this, I argue that students should be the ones designing these projects 
Im both with and against this .

Ill be sumerizing the article over venus and why it is not we can not step foot on this planet. 
Summer projects given over the break period should be moderately designed by the students themselves 
When a student is given the power to design their own project, it allows the student to grow mentally and help broaden their learning horizons. 
cell phone use can very deadly for teen drivers 
The teachers give out this project for the whole purpose that given project helps students move forward, they assigned the project to the individual students knowing what would help them grow without having the summer break erasing everything they learned the previous year.�

Like i've stated before, change can go in a good or bad way. There is no way saying it could be both or could be something completly different. We just got to be careful with what we have now or they may be no future. 
In situations where summer projects are assigned, projects should be student-designed 
Some people perform an impressive calculation on her feelings by the look of her face. 
I remember that one time I tried to convince some other people to join the program. It didn't go so well.

Although some may disagree that student projects should be designed by teachers, it should be known that this is not true.

"

I am a scientist at NASA who is trying to tell you that the landform you saw on mars is nothing more than just a natural landform. 
its great to travel hopfully you'll concider it 
The Summer Project should be student designed during break. 
Would'nt you love to be on a cattle boat and sail to unique places and help people in need? In the passage Luke does exactally that. 
"But at the point to that technology knows what are your emotions to then use them on ""what you need"" is not correct "
"I think that we should explore Venus because we should be able to know all of our solar system, but it will be challenging, because of the temperatures, and the pressure. 
"
The author supports the idea of taking the challenge to Venus by stating that the planet is worth studying for regardless of what dangers pursue them 
I think the better way for the car problems, is to have all people discuss the problems and explain what is best for other people. 
"The ""Facial Action Conding System"" would be a good technique for teachers to see if the students were paying attention during class, and if they were not how could they help him improve. "
If I were to have to complete a summer project, I would want it to be a teacher-designed project. 
The face on mars is just a lndform 
The behavior is very dangerous and causes death do to not paying attention to the road 
However, it is highly imposable for it to be an alien momument, as they would have to have oxygen to survive,and they would have to find plenty of food and water to also survive. 
I'm for the new technology Facial Action Coding System 
I disagree, because some times there is nothing there that interest

"
The way that i see it is that the author put a lot of reseach into venus and study it 
I think people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program,

The faicl action coding seems like a good idea. 
In America's evolving society, and the evolving global economy, limiting car usage stands benefically 
Even though teacher designed summer projects tend to broaden the student's skills by giving them tasks they are somewhat uncomfortable with, it is better for projects to be student designed 
The Author support the idea that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers

"
For students in a classroom to use this software could be valuable.

You should participate in the Seagoing cowboys 
I am for the value of this technollogy to read students emotional expressions. 
Also NASA has no reason to try to cover up any civilization that we may not know about because they will be benifiting from that with more tax money from the government 
that is why you should go and do that program 
The advantages of limiting car usage would help decrease, or even eliminate greenhouse gases. 
people had many reasons to believe what they believed. Michael Malin had to find out the answer and find out what exaclty made it. That's exaclty what he did. He found out it was just a landform that resembled a face. 
Summer assignments should be teacher-designed 
Summer projects should be student-designed 
I disagree with this decision because you go to school to learn about what you need to know for the future. You don't go to school to learn about sports, or learn how to make yearbooks. You don't go to school to get pushed by someone about something you don't want to do. You should be able to have your own choice. 
Ok with starting this off i would say that i am against this 
The reson you should join this organization 
I am all for this new technology to read peoples emotions

Student-designed summer projects would be more beneficial than teacher-designed 
the possibility of there being aleins is very unrealistic. 
I think that it would be good for students in many ways, 
Although many may say that there would be nothing to gain by researching Venus. There would be something gained when researching Venus 
Venus is to me is yes it is worth pursuiting despite all of its dangers to the human life form 
The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because the planet itself is dangerous 
NASA has plenty information and data for why it's just a natural landform. 
"No one, not even the most skilled driver in the world should be able to use a cell phone in any way while driving. 
"
I agree with the�principal 
This whole facial recognition thing is awesome and I think that it is safe for us humans. 
in the beginning of the story it is saying that the people and cars are able to work together because it will stay there and be with them most of that. 
And not even that i would prove that guy in the lab wrong that it is not even aliens that it is just sand and rock. 
Technology that reads people's emotions would be beneficial in a classroom setting, 
You should particpate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. 
I believe that being a Seagoing Cowboy is worth the risk

So I would say that it really isnt valuable. 
Stop with the constant use of cars.

You migh think we are at a dead end on trying to explore Venus but if you think that you are right. NASA needs to be able to form new techonagly before we can do anything else on Venus. That is a challenge NASA has accetpiced is to keep trying for Venus.  
I don't think that this is valuable for students in a classroom just to read their emotions 
The expressions would be a good tool to use in classrooms 
You should join the Seagoing Cowboy and UNRRA program 
Venus is an interesting planet for various reasons. 
Their are many benefits to having the summer project and it being teacher designed since most students do almost all school work teacher designed so the students have some experience.

But I'm in the side of not using your phone while driving. 
Schools that assign summer projects should give students the privilege to explore their interests, while encouraging creativity. Furthermore, schools that assign summer projects should allow students to design their own project because all students are under different circumstances and students should be allowed to be creative, especially in environments outside of school. 
When it comes down to it the aurthor as you can tell heavily supports the thought of traveling to Venus. 
As the student, it's your job to complete a task, and you should have no complaints over a project designed yourself. 
"This is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboy program. 
"
I belive that using the Facial Action Coding System can value to students in many ways. in the classroom 
Despite its putative effectiveness in other fields such as advertisement or marketing, Facial Action Coding System technology possesses no place of value in a classroom and would serve as a hinderence to a student's learning process. 
Why should we limit our uses on car usages

a student designed project would be vastly more effective.

I think the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) should be used in classrooms because it would help to see the emotions of kids. 
We know that Venus is a planet and that Venus is closest to Earth but some poeple might not know how danger Venus has.

The Challenges of Exploring Venus can be very scary but also very worth it. 
I think the arthor suported the idea well 
They shouldnt even limit cars. 
you should join the Seagoing Cowboys 
Well, having extracurricular activities after school can help with that. 
I believe that for students to complete a summer project, that the students should be the designers of the projects. 
There are various reasons to mandate one extracurricular activity and the principal should have no problem enacting this idea. 
Summer projects should be based on student designed. 
if a student is allowed the choice of topic for their summer project it would be better off for all parties 
I believe that the Face found on Mars is just a natural landform 
To make it more enjoyable, I believe that these summer projects should at least be student-designed for various reasons.

It may sound far fetched, but actually, FACS may be the best thing to come to schools 
I think people should join the program 
you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. 
limiting car usage can have many advantages 
Forced extracurricular activities will benefit students in many ways, especially by motivating ones that do not typically do activities 
"Students should be required to do at least one extracurricular activity. 
"
I dont think technology can tell someone in emotes by scanning their face. 
Teachers have always wondered how their students were feeling at all times during their lesson, and this software can help them reach out to their students tremendously 
The passage talks about all the positive and negative things that would make Venus be good to study because of some of theories of it being Earth like

i tthink we shouldnt be able to have technology read are emotions if we dont want it to. 
I think they shouldn't explore Venus because it's a suicide mission it's too hot a lot of co2 and temperatures reach over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. 
This is a rock that had just been formed like this. It had been forming to look like this for years. 
Limiting car usage is something that we all need to do. 
I disagree with making kids do extracurricular activity 
I think students should designed. students can do this well. 
that would be unseen for there to be a computer of any such to even exist. 
I think that it is a very useful thing 
Well i think it can and should be brought to teachers and schools to really crack doown on well, reckless teenagers. 
"The FACS technology can be utilized in the classroom in may ways with few downfalls. 
"
In today's society we know that its alot of emotions being shown throughout the world no matter what's the case is.

While teacher-designed summer projects don't necessarily allow students to learn about what interests them, they give students the best preparation for the class ahead 
I thinks the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enbles computers to indenify humans emotions is good things 
The use of FACS should not be used to see if children are happy in the class room. 
I don't think this would be helpful in a classroom because it would just be a waste 
I agree that some schools should let students do summer projects sometime over the summer. 
The author supports his idea by adding tons of pro-Venus exploration details throughout the passage. 
Well I feel that we shlould not use tecnology to view somone's feelings. 
Plan My claim would have to be that computers who identify human emotions would be a valubale thinkg because many students come to class felling down or sad sometimes and instead of them keeping i to them selves. 
This technology should not be used in a classroom environment. 
Today. I think it will be a great opportunity for you too by joining the Seagoing Cowboys program. 
You can also conclude that there are no alien's roaming around in space making face's on landform's. 
In the passage the Author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit desite the dangers it presents.

"In the aricle ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" says that Venus is really good to study despite the dangers you might encounter. The article says that you may study it,imagen all the wonders you can find. "
I would say i am on both sides. 
The use of this technology is to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable to me 
Summer projects should be teacher-designed

Having students participate in at least one extracurricular activity allows them to socialize with students, participate in activities they enjoy or even find something new to try.

I think that tthe Facial Action Coding Sysytem or the facs for short is a great tool that could opne new door that were prevasily clouse befor. 
"in the ""challenge of exploring venus"" the author says that venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. He supports all his claims further in to the article. "
This technology is not the right way to find students human emotions. 
this essay is to imfomr felloe citizens about the advantages og limiting car usage

By doing a Facial Action Coding to a classroom full of students would be different and interesring 
The author talks about how the value of retuning to vanes is important and worth it. 
I do not think that the use of this technology on the students in the classroom is valuable 
I think alot of people take the whole no car thing the wrong way, cause lets face it there no way we could go without cars. 
that object that was found on mars is only land built up that looks some what like a face and not a statue or remains of a living person or creature. but something that was a different landform a long time ago before it became what is know as the face on mars. 
I think that the Face is just a oddly shaped rock

Luke has a certain point of view on convincing others to participate in this program 
Even though it is dangerous, the author makes a valid point, NASA should be determined to research Venus since the discoveries made there can possibly give insight on what Earth may become. 
After all,�extracurricular activities are beneficial to students 
THE PASSAGE IS INFORMING FELLOW CITIZENS ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES OF LIMIT CAR USAGE 
These summer projects should be student-designed 
This technology is valuble to the the classroom in my opinion 
"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is suggesting that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. "

Avoiding the usage of cars has many positives 
In our world today the technolgy is so wonderful it can changes images with the click of a button. 
The responsibility of designing a project that is forced upon students during their time off should be held by teachers. 
In my opinion I say that people should not use their cell phone while driving. 
I believe that students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, 
Although extracurricular�activities�are just as beneficial to a students educational experience as in-school classes, students should be able to have the option to choose whether they would wish to participate in the activities. 
The face looks like Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. 
I am arguing that it is valuable. 
"The author does a pretty nice job at explaining all the dangers of Venus. The author provides the readers with all the information that is necessary, for the space program. Although Venus is dangerous, scientists are still willing to find out about it. 
"
limiting car usage would be advantageous 
phones should not be aloud to be operated by a human in any sort of way while driving. 
The principal should not force all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity 
I think that the auther is right about studying venus is worth pursuit despite the dangers it presents 
It is a valid opinion to believe that the projects should be teacher-designed. There are many reasons for the projects to be designed by teachers 
Being a part of the Seagoing Cowboys was a great experience. I had no idea that it would be as much fun as it turned out to be. 
Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving. 
Therefore when summer comes around summer projects should be student-designed 
what we could do is replace gas cars with water or oil solarpowered cars. what we can do is replace the road with heat sensor pannels and replace the cars fuel line with eigther a solar based power syatem or used water for the fuel supply. 
If we limit the use of cars 
The new software could help others become more energectic and happier on most days other than frowning and having an awful day. 
the new technolgy would be very valuable for school class rooms in this day and age. 
This is my deatlis to back the witer on his claim how how studying venus is both worthy and dangerousand to explain how the author backs himself up on his claim. He gives alot of good points 
Should you be using your cellular device while driving a vehicle? In my opinion you shouldn't use your phone while driving. 
The aouthor idea might sound or be a little bit carzy. The author however is not wrong, 
Student-designed projects where kids can do a project that pertains to their certain hobbies and summer adventures are better than teacher-designed projects� 
"In the story ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the autheor suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents "
If technology, that can read and tell your emotions is put into a classroom, then many students wouldnt be focused on schoolwork theyll be focused on a dumb app or piece of technology that can read your emotions.

"The author gives great examples of ways too explore the planet safely and effectivly, also he gives reasons why it would be beneficial. 
"
Mandatory participation in extracurricular activities is not good for students

I for one would be in love with this idea. 
IN CONCLUTION PEOPLE DONT NEED CARS

"
Cars are a luxury, not a necessity, and now they might not even be as usefull. 
stop replacing humans with machines 
These photo's that were taken by NASA are rock formations. 
If there are no more of the planets then we could go to Venus, but we should explore others first to see if they are more suitable for people to live on. 
So this computer can be also useful to see what people from the past felt during those time to see if they had any emotions or did they not. 
Although many people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences and studies showing that the use of a cell phone while conducting a vehicle is dangerous and people should avoid using them while driving. 
You should become a Seagoing Cowboy 
I disagree with the principal's idea of making all students do one extracurricular activity. 
people should stop relying on cars to get them where they need to and depend on themselves because eventually the end to cars will come. 
"getting rid of cars for one day ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" "
I feel students should be favored in the designing of their summer projects 
"Yet, the author sees that mankind cannot be afraid of the risks when the rewards are so great. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents "
Certainly, these projects should be left to the teacher. 
Venus, as the author talks about, was a worthy pursuit becuase they had found very good and ineresting findings 
If you were to compare the pros and cons, the answer is yes! 
The use of this technology to read the emotional expression of students in a classroom IS valuable. 
The face on Mars is just a natural landform

The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students is a good idea. 
The use of this technology in a classroom would be useful 
I agree and disagree with the principals decision. 
The question remains, what are the advantages of limiting car usage? 
Drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because the action is extremely dangerous for every person on the road. 
So what the picture actully shwode was the martin equivalent of a butt or mesa land forms common around the american 
"As they say ""There is a time and place for everything"" (Gloria Tesch), and driving is not the time and place "
If schools were to change summer projects to student-designed instead of teacher-designed 
There are many facts to show this is a natural landform. 
Not everyone has cars or uses cars for that matter. 
"They say the ""Face on Mars"" was made by natural land forming. That is true "
If students are required to complete a summer project, it must be student-designed 
They should do the program because in the program you will learn how to be a cowboy 
"and i think the facial actial action coding system maybe good maybe bad. 
"
Concluding with what i said at the beginning, the pictures we see are nothing more than a mesa. 
I agree with the article 
In my opinion I don't think we should be able to 
"I am going to be telling you why this is just a natural landform on Mars. 
"
Now in days a machines can tell you how exactly you feel!. We are humans, but technology could change how we think, how we act and high chances how we live 
People from the NASA think that aliens built the face on Mars, but actually it is a natural landform. 
I think that this new technology is bad for anyone to even have. 
The face is a landform because the planet must of formed it a long time ago. 
I believe the image of the Viking is just a landform and it wasn't created by aliens. I will explain to you why i think it's a landform. 
If the technology of the Facial Action Coding System was that powerful ir smart to read students emotions, it would be good and cool. 
Venus will be a great planet to live on. Imagine if you could have a house on earth and one on Venus. 
"Do you wanna take care of horses,young cows,and mules? Well if you do,Join the Seagoing Cowboys in taking our adventure ot help people anad places bombed in World War ll. 
"
Thats one of the many reasons why Venus is dangerous to mankind 
Drivers shouldn't be able to use devices while driving. 
I strongly believe that this is not an alien, and that this is a natural landform.                              
Luke had an amazing adventure being a Seagoing Cowboy, he discovered the world and was given a once in a lifetime opportunity. 
Extracurricular activities should be mandatory�because kids could look forward to activities after school instead of going home and sitting around for hours.� 
techonology called the ficial Action coding System enavles computer to identify human emotions is really good thing. 
Some advantages of limiting car usage that the United States will benifit from include 
Summer projects should be student-designed 
These summer projects should be student-designed 
I think that it would be useful in a classroom 
it would be a great idea for you to participate in the Seagoing program. 
i say this because Face is a naural landform found on mars. 
It has been scientifically proven that the Face is nothing more than a rocky landform. 
In conclusion there was no actually face on Mars,And the entire time it was only a landform which there are very many of on the entire planet of Mars.      
In my opinion, Im against of the value of using technology to read students emotional expresses. 
I believe that the Facial Action Coding Sydtem could work. 
From what I read, I can intake that yes it can be dangerous as I stated in the second paragraph, it can risk lives, but at the same time life is full of risks. It's important to me as well as I'm sure it is to others, to know if there can be another life somewhere completely different and that not being a state or country by any means, it's literally a different planet. Therefore, traveling outside of Earth is a huge challenge, but fear shouldn't stop us from gaining such innovation for our future. 
The advantages of limiting car usage 
I think that everyone should join the Seagoing Cowboys program 
While the idea of using a Facial Action Coding System in the educational process would certainly be interesting, I do not think it is nearly advanced enough to be able to be used in modern schools. 
Venus is a worthy planet because it does not have all of man kind on it destroying it or usig it. Venus is a place where some people go to see outisde of our world to see what space really does look like. 
The notion that cell phones should be used while on the road is very disturbing and quiet unacceptable 
Although, many people may think that going to Venus despite the dangers is not a good idea going to venus can also be benitfical with new safety measures, and technolgy. 
In my opinion i think that they should use The Facial action coding system 
The Facial Action Coding System is an invasion of privacy and should not be used in classrooms or on students. 
"No. "" FACS"" will not be valuable to read the emotional expressions of students. "
Now while a student-designed project has its benefits, the teachers should be designing the assignments 
To avoid this, as well as a multitude of other issues, summer projects should be designed by the students, 
I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a good idea for the studetns in the classroom. 
"here are the great value of using technology.

there is sofeware that can recongize emotions better ways foe human and computer to commmunic. "
The author uses connotations by suggesting that venus is a worthy pursuit is studying but the dangers that it has is that it's the hottest planet in the solar system 
There are advantages of limiting car usage, but not as much as you thought. 
While driving is a privilege we have today. When you text and drive you not only put yourself at risk you put innocent drives at stake 
If I was the a scientist at NASA talking to someone about why the face on mars wasent created by aliens i would tell them that extra terrestrial life couldn't of done that 
Me myself agreed with this decision 
"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", uses many scientific facts, data, and explanations to support their idea of exploring Venus. In the passage, many examples are given of why scientists would want to explore the possibilities of the contents of Venus despite all the dangers. "
using the techonology of emotionalnally expressions of students in a classrom is valuable 
. Reducing car usage by building public transportation and smart suburbs would be ideal. 
Have you guys ever seen the unmasking face on Mars? If not you probably should! 
So this prosses sound like cool but it just show how much computer can do it not meaing it 100 right. 
There are many reasons you should 
it really depends on your responsibility level if you can't stay off your phone and it's life then you need to let someone drive but if you can be responsible while driving then I'd say you should us your phone responsibly 
Life without cars can also be beneficial to ones community 
This is a great idea, and it would be better if the students would be able to pick the topic. 
Contrary to popular belief, limiting car usage can be benefcial to many. 
On the other hand, they should not be required for all students to participate in. 
there is nor was there ever any real evidence supporting the martion monument claim. However there is evidence proveing that the face is realy a mesa! 
I don't think that studying Venus i a worthy pursuit 
it brings plenty of advantages to make up for what could be seen by some as a troublesome lack of easy transportation. 
Luke's point of view convincing people to participate in the seagoin. 
Its nice to see a country actually care about what it is doing to the enviroment, but it might take something big for other countrys to follow suit. 
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. "
We should go to Venus even with its dangers 
In Lukes point of view to convise others to come would be it would be a lot of fun 
it would be a great idea to lower car usage since it is so detrimental to the health of the enviroment and the health of the populace. 
The technology fro read the emotionals expressions, its something aswesome. 
"
I think the use of the Facial Action Coding System is a well needed thing for schools "
Drivers shouldn't be able to use cell phones during driving 
I ''agree'' with the principal 
Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity 
While there is much debate on whether the student should have the right to design these projects, the best option is for these projects to be teacher-designed. 
I don't believe a technology can identify human emotions 
a computer cannot tell whether a person is happy, sad, fear,angry. 
In the article the author supports this idea 
yes you should do extracurriculars 
If people limited the use of cars the earth would be able to have enough time to clean its atmosphere 
'After all that happened nobody was not really sure which one was the right one. 
arguing wheater use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuble? Yes 
it could just be a rock formation and that the sun was shining on the rock in just the way that it looked like a face. Also who knows we could have just been in the right place at the right time 
It may be mistaken that it is unhabitable for humanity, but there is a possiblity for humanity to live on other planet. There is reasons for saying those things about Venus. This is an other aticle to explain why Venus is habitable for humanity. 
I think that it is a good idea to make us take a school extracurricular activity. 
i think that we should use this technology at school to read the students emotions. 
"although teachers can make sure students doing what they need; I personally believe that it should be student "
"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the authors support to his knowledge of Venus is very informative. "
There is only sign of one so there for it does not exist as of the evidence given it is simply just a mesa, a mesa is a rock formation. 
The summer projects should be student-designed. 
I am against this topic 
I think people shouldn't be able to use their phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle. 
People should agree that the face on Mars was probably an accident. The face probably was not a face, it could have been another Martian mesa. 
So if join this program than you will have the time of your life and you will probly will do the same things Luke did. 
The author states that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. 
We should reduce the use of car 
The summer projects should be teacher-designed 
I think the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. 
Although teacher-designed projects can be seen as desirable, summer projects should be student-designed 
I am going to have to agree 
My principal has decided for all students would have to participate in one extrarricular activity. 
These summer projects should be student-designed 
"Drivers should not be able to use them or even have them in their hand,lap, or etic while they are in the act of operating a vehicle. 
"
Studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers 
they can also use there cars less 
In my opinion, I think this techonology is useful, especially in order to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. 
It's better to keep doing more research about it instead of just going without knowing everything about the planet. 
So I think its a good idea to have to something that able to do something like this. 
The author suggest that studying venus is a worthy pursuit 
"Reasons that people like Luke became or are going to be a Seagoing

Cowboy is because they like to help people in need that need food a shelter. They don't just do it to go to Europe and see everything and to have fun, they do it because they care about other people. "
"Should we have a facial action coding system for schools?

I do and do not think we should. "
In this article, the author is telling it's readers that traveling to Venus can be risky. 
This is something that has been well thought out by NASA and they always know what , why and how they are doing something. The author uses insite from NASA to support his idea. By doing this the author has shown us the importance of Venus. 
In all, the author did really good with this article and also put some good time into this article too. I enjoyed reading this and learned some interesting facts about Venus. 
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. "
I think it's just a landscape trick. It happens all the time. Like the potatoe with a face on it. 
Astronots and scientists have been tryong to beat the challenges of Venus. 
Those are things that can be cool to find out but it can also can be really valuable in a classrom. 
"Im going to tell about how the author of the article ''The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is trying to convince people to explore and stuying one of our 8 plants called ""Venus"". "
Advantages include 
This new FACS computer is a really cool new technology system used in Advancd Science at the University of Illinois. 
Why would you want to limit car usage. 
Using less cars would also have more benefits for all of us. 
the people should drive less. 
"The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by saying ,""Venus is Earth's twin and closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size"". "
In my opinion, this technology should be implemented into classrooms internationally 
Using this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable 
The principle wants all students to take at least one extracurricular�activity I agree with the principle 
I feel as if this could help in the classroom but not as much as Dr. Huang thinks 
When it comes to the technology that reads students emotions I think its a great idea of having it in classrooms 
Summer projects assigned to kids should be allowed to be student designed 
It's for this reason why I think that all students should have to do at least one extracurricular activity, 
The author suggests that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents 
"""The Challenging of Exploring Venus"", many scientists are wanting to exlpore Venus atmosphere. But it comes with risk and danger, possibly NASA scientists can break through that "
Altought there are many dangers- such as the temperature, atmophere, and natural distaters- Venus has many good qualities and is very similar to Earth. 
i should limit my car usage 
he strongly believes that it is possible, and not only believes that we could travel to Venus but encourages it. 
The program Seagoing Cowboys ,is amazing even though u might of heard of it or not im going to try my best to make u want to be part of it. 
Having mandatory extra curricular�activities will be a disaster 
My principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree with my principal 
Im going to tell you if the facial action coding system is a good or bad idea 
I belive the advantages of limitng a car usage. 
How the author support his suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents is 
The apparent solution is that the teachers should be assigning these projects 
"No the rock formation is natural. 
"
I think the use of this technology is useful to all students, parents, governement workers, and etc. 
I agree with our principle that it should be mandatory to take at least one extracurricular activity. 
I would encourage a lot of people to join the Seagoing Cowboy program 
In my opinion, you should choose at least one extracurricular activity to do after school. 
the child should have a choice weather or not they want do after school�or not. 
"The scientist thinks that the face was madeby aliens but I think it wasn't that it's just a natural landform. 
"
As the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents, I agree with him 
I think that it can be no or yes. 
I believe that the author did very well supporting his claim 
The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable 
"Thus, teachers should design the summer projects instead of students, as they know what the student would benefit from. 
"
the face on Mars is actually just another rock formation. 
I'm fore the value of using this technology to read students emotional experssions 
What I think about FACS is that we dont need it 
The student don't need there emotion's expressed some like it hidden. 
However NASA has provided evidence that proves the face on Mars is actually just a natural landform. 
Based of the information they staed in the passage i do believe that the teachnology called Facial Action Coding System can identify human emotion. 
"teacher-designed summer projects are tailored to the expectations of discipline and knowledge held for their students. 
"
he had did good about ut he did good going to venas would be good 
its is ever challenging visting, trying to do go and rescreach on a plant where you dont know anything about it. 
The author did a very good job at supporting how dangerous exploring Venus is but how it also is a very cool planet to explore. 
I think that summer projects should be student designed 
So all i just said is basicly saying i don`t want this to be used. 
"The story ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" Main purpuse was to in form us of the stugles of trying to find a whay to get humons on Venus, "
The author had some detailed ideas that weren't explained really good 
In my personal opinion, I think that it would be very valuable 
They give many good points, but ultimately fail at their task to convince readers that Venus exploration is worth it. Along with a failed point, this author tends to go off on side-tangents that have minimal importance to the story. 
Two of the many advantages of limiting the use of cars are 
The Facial Action Coding System could be valuable in classrooms 
Many of the scientist are starting to wonder if this face was created by aliens. Scientists have tooked camera over and there is no alien monument after all, 
the students should create a project 
"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author does a poor job of supporting the idea that studying a planet as dangerous as Venus is worth it. "
I think it was just a landform and many people argue about this.       
Finally, Despite the chanlleges and dangers they are all striving to meet the challenge. 
Summer projects need to be student-designed 
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author gives their support to the idea of exploring the planet Venus. "
"people shuld participate in the program. 
"
Strivind to meet the callenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself. 
I belive that summer projects should be student-designed 
With today's technology we are able to see that it's just another landform on Mars. 
Texting while driving is a big problem though out the world with the death rate going up every year. 
The use of this technology to read the emotionl expressions of students in a classroom is valuable 
Students should have the projects be teacher-designed because if students designed the projects they would be easier than if the teachers designed them. 
The author supports this idea by giving information how its different from today then on the 1940s. 
"Out of all the plants in the universe, I didn't think that there was going to be another ""Earth."" Many perople are scraed to travel out side of earth. I would also be scared. There is one "" Earth-like "" planet. Venus has very dangerous charateristics. "
I believe that using this in a classroom will be valuable. 
Summer assignments are, rightfully so, teacher created assignments 
I think that students should participate in one or more school extracurricular activity. 
Although some may people think teacher designed is better nevertheless, student designed is better 
Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity during school 
This Facial Action Coding System is identifing the moment of the face right that minute, but not what they are feeling right after or before. 
that is just what people believe, they think aliens were the reason for those faces but from what NASA has to say about it, all these people are wrong. 
studying venus is something that you would have to do 
In some cases yes it might work for some people, but definetly not everyone. 
Teacher based projects can be proved more superior by using current event, historical, and personal examples. 
"No, the author did not evaluate his idea good enough there wasn't enough supporting details to support his claim ""Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents"". "
In order to avoid this, a summer project should be designed by teachers instead of students 
Science can unlock and find a lot of new things and emotion is one 
Being able to detect how other people are feeling can be a satisfiying and critical thing to use or to know 
After reading the passage I came to the conclusion that some ways I think it's not valueble 
Due to the risks posed by using a cell phone when driving, cell phones use should be banned when operating a vehicle. 
i think its dumb and i do not agree because its dumb no one�likes extra stuff in school because its boring 
it should be student designed 
"But noticing ourself that it wasn't true that it wasn't real. 
"
i dont think its need in our schopols 
"So i say you should go and get a extracurricular activity it would be fun! 
"
I think we should use this technology 
"This tech can become useless and useful in many situations. 
"
The author suggest the reader to study Venus isnt directly in the text but he/she gives you the idea that you should look into it. 
I think we should leave her face the way is orginally on the way it is from the way the arginol person painted it. It is being very respectful on how the painting is being displaied in different musemes here around the world. 
Teachers should be the ones to design our summer projects for many different reasons.

It is contradictive that he decided to include facts and data that went against his own thoughts because he came back and listed data that went against the negative statements. The author created confusion to what he actually believes. 
Striving to meet Venus is challenging But one challenge were willin to take 
Yes the planet sounds to good to be true but if that is what we have that is atleast like earth we should give it a try. considering the fact of life on another planet is fascinating

Venus poses several dangerous obsticles to pursuit because of how dangerous the planet actually is, which makes the time of pursuing the planet not reasonable and not worth the time for scientist

Adavntages of limiting your car usage can actually be benifitical to you and your family, maybe even the earth you live on. 
Forcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity is unethical and promotes involuntary participation to students who are already busy managing grades and a social life

Motorized vehicles have put a tole on our environment, our well being, and our wallets.

My honest oppinion on this topic is that we should not be exploring Venus right now. We just don't have the right technology for it right now. 
Although teacher-designed projects would be beneficial for learning in more detail, summer projects should be student-designed 
I am going to argue for the value of having the Facial Action Coding System in the computers. 
I think venus is not worth the try. 
If we were to introduce the new FACS technology, it may have unindended lasting impacts which could be detrimental to our society. 
This technology is a good idea to all students in a classroom who is feeling different emotions. 
Extracurricular activities are a great option 
The Facial Action Coding System is not a valuable to students 
This face is not created by aliens. 
Although limiting car usage may seem out of the ordinary, it has many benefits that appeal to people. 
The use of technology suchas, Facial Action Coding system, is totally uneccessary in the classroom setting. 
Summer school projects should be student-designed

By carefully examining the text and pondering their ideas of the planets surface and difficuties of gaining access to venus , one could definitely say that yes, the author does support their idea very well. But this is a planet that can crush submarines like soda cans. 
"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author thinks studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers, but does not support this idea very well. "
The author certainly proves their idea on why they think studying the planet Venus is worth it. The author supports their idea by making sure to back it up with evidence. 
After all would you decide to help out and figure out more about Venus? Scientist are doing a great job so far with everything they are figuring out about what could be more helpful to them. They also know that is can be safe for them to hover over Venus instead of landing on it and having a horrible tragidy. 
There are a lot of advantages on why we should limit car usage 
Limiting car usage is a great idea 
With this in mind, the idea that using Facial Action Coding Systems in classrooms would be valuable is not only true, but something that should be acted upon. (D'Alto). 
Summer projects should be designed by students

In the paragraph 8, the last line, it said ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". "
why should we stop driving cars? 
Students should at least participate in one extracurricular activity 
The Face on Mars formed to be a natural land form, so scientists told the people that there was no alien life form and that they were safe from harm. 
In this story the author is trying to claim that venus is worthy of to explore even tho venus is dangerous 
Some say that aliens made it, but others said that it is a landform 
"this is just a natural landform created on Mars. 
"
I will be trying to convince the population to beleive that the face's on Mars are natural landforms. 
I think these projects should be teacher-designed because in my opinion it would be better and it would actually help them more. 
Teachers should be designing these summer project 
Studying Venus closely is worth the risk for more information on Venus. 
if everyone has a new car if every one one the planet has a new car and is always driving, we have better get to bying gas masks 
I sure wouldnt Want a job like that!!!!!!!!!        
scientist should keep studing venus. 
If a principal made every student engage in an extracurricular activity, I would disagree. I do not think students should be forced to do certain activities 
I am going to show you both sides why it would be good to go and why it wouldn't be good to go 
I still believe that students should be the ones to design it. 
In my opion show the emotion is very important bacuse it will show the tacher if you understand the lesson or not.

Lukes point of vew is that Luke is trying to get people to partisapatein the seagoing cowboys program 
You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program! 
The author studying is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents from the article 
The author supports his story very well i think. He knows what he's talking about to be able to wright a story over it.

The Law has been made in Georgia that requires hands free driving, that means people can drive and talk on the phone without touching the phone. The Law is still not as helpful as expected 
Limiting care usage is an advantage 
The summer projects should be designed specifically by students 
I don't buy it. Rejecting car culture is certainly the dumbest alternative decisions that anyone has to make. 
I believe that while the answer is not simple, students should overwhelmingly be in charge in terms of the creation of these assignments, 
Since it is students who do the projects, why not let them decide what those projects should be?

letting students design their own projects gives them more freedom, allowing them to think outside the box, which aids the development of valuable skills that are applicable in the real world. Instead of teaching students how to follow directions on a rubric, we should be teaching them to think creatively and how to collaborate with one another. 
The author tells us how hard and difficult it is to land or even study venus because its so hard to land on or get close to because of all the dangerous things that can happen.

i dont think it is such a good idea.

Summer projects should be student driven, due to the fact that they allow for self-motivation and individualism, as long as teachers are able to monitor the progress and quality of the work being done. 
The use of this technology to read students' emotional expressions is a good idea. 
Making suburbs much more compact then they are right now will lead to less car usage. 
I believe that students should choose at least one extracurricular activity,because it will make students more social,and they get to see what they like doing.

in conclusion the many way we show emotions can be mixed up. 
But using the Facial Action Coding System (or FACS) on classroom full with students could be a good/bad idea 
Scientists have credible information that shows people it is just a natural landform. 
I do not support the use of texting and driving due to the high risk that involves with usage of a technology while driving 
I think not,its not a good idea to mein 2 ways. 
I personally dont think this is a good rule for various reasons

i personialty think the program would be awesome to have. 
We all need to do the right thing by following the law and give up phones while driving. 
To combat this, schools should allow students to design their own projects 
By being allowed to design their own summer projects, students are afforded significantly many more opportunities to learn outside of the classroom and are also able to accomplish their project with a degree of flexibility, letting them both enjoy their time off but also retain information that they learned the previous year. 
"The author suggest Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents and i completly agree with that . But im here to prove why his idea is valuable and correct.

In conclusion, texting and driving is really not a great idea, while it comes to texting or being on a phone call.

It is able to distinguish individual expressions such as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness which humans can find hard to do making it vital to being infused into the use of schools. 
I think this should completely changed around and make it to the point where they should take away when driving. 
Partaking in extracurricular activities is a fun way to get yourself involved in doing something you like or trying something new if that thing interests you. Personally I'm all for it, I think that having extracurricular activities is fun and can even be something new. 
a teacher-designed project would be beneficial

I must say that, in my opinion The Face on Mars is indeed NOT created by aliens. It is simply illogical. 
In the end, the advantages of limiting car usage are as bountiful as fish in the ocean. 
I do not believe that the Face was caused by aliens. 
The author presents a strong argument suggesting a worthy pursuit to study Venus depsite dangerous endeavors, however, his statments regauarding un-reliability on current technology, the necessary actions to conduct research, and numerous failed attempts to reach Venus greatly outweigh the good outcomes of this mission. 
In my opinion I think that the author did a great job on sjowing the dangers of venus beause he gave a lot of information. 
In my opinion, there is no reason why students should need a computer to read their facial expressions inside of the the classroom. 
the use of software to determine the emotional expressions of students in the classroom is not valuable to the students learning experience. 
I am against using the value of technology to read students' emotional expressions. 
So having this machine woud not be good to have because some teacher could be nosy and ask why are you mad or sad 
People shouldn't be able to use phone while they're driving, but at the same time people need their phone in case of an emergency. Or if their job requires using their phone and driving at the same time they'll have to use their phone 
"""What are some advantages of limiting car usage? "
but there would be much difficulty without the utilization of cars during this modern era. 
The author does a good job of these statements because they give some examples to both sides as to why or why not there should be a study on life on Venus. The author seem to have thrown in a few claims to create an arguement for both sides if its a good idea or not. 
The article gives plenty of prove to show that the machine could be a benefit to are students 
I belive thate the face is just a natural landform becouse of facts 
If they want the projects to be successful they must set a broad topic and allow the students to chose anything they want under that umbrella topic. 
Disagree, There are many reasons that we many not be able to go and do extracurricular activities 
I think that fellow citizens should have the advantages to car usage, because not everyone would feel comfortable ridding around in a bus or a train with lots of other people 
Facial action coding sytsem should be used because it is a good way to help students and people, 
I'm against this technology that reads your emotions 
But I slighlty do think this is somewhat a good idea 
"Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while driving because in a matter of seconds you, your family or someone else's life could be put in danger or worse, taken away. 
"
The simeple ancer is computers. Also, there is sicince to derturmin how female faces have change over the years. There is also talking to pefrenciles to recrate it. 
The face on mars is a natural landformation. People beleive it was made by aliens but it was not 
All this information was from the Article and I believe that it is just a landform.   
Extracurricular activities should be required in schools 
. I feel like we should amd should be able to study Venus from a close range. I think the dangers can be overcomed with lots of training and simulations that are inspried by Venus's harsh condistions. I also belive that we can survie venus with good technology. 
They should be designed by students, they can choose a topic that they would prefer or something that isn't too hard on them. 
I think the author did a good job in explaining the conditions of the Venus and all of its surprises it holds for us to find. 
Teachers would have to think if this is really worth having, or is it going to do nothing for them. 
I think if we can study Venus up close we'll get a better understanding of the planet, like what materials it has and how the weather conditions are. 
The summer projects should be designed by the teachers 
But technology is good in so many ways but its bad in so many ways to. I think your emotions shoud stay to you if thats what you want and not base on if the technology want to know. 
If every student were to participate is a after school activity or sport, then the school would keep getting better. 
I agree with the principal 
The author of this article seems to be in full support of pursuing the dangerous planet, but why thats what I'm here to tell you. 
I think that we should try and go vist Venus 
I work for NASA and I have have found pictures about a face on Mars and through my perpectives I believe that its an alien on the surface on Mars. 
I think that by reading a person's emotions is not the best way to know if the person is depress or happy. 
These choices should be up to the students designe 
The Face is just a natural landform! 
Smog, backed up traffic ways, and stress seem to be the main factor contributing to the decrease in car usage. Although these seem to be very negative factors, there are many advantages to limiting car use including helping our Planet Earth and less costly factors. 
"In ""THE CHALLENGE OF EXPLORING VENUS"" the author of suggests that studys venus is worthy pursuit despite the danger it peresnts. 
"
While the Facial Action Coding System detects facial expressions that indicate a person's emotion, the system built in a classroom computer is valuable to students, because it can manipulate the lesson based on how students are learning. 
Although some might argue that the project should be student-designed, it should be a teacher-designed. 
No they should not use the technology in class rooms because thats a invashion of pricicy. 
I think that is should be used. 
I am against that the technology doesn't have the support to make her smile 
We should explore venus 
Limiting car use is not a new idea. 
"summer projects should be teacher-designed. 
"
I think using the Facial action coding system in students in a classroom is not good and the same thime bad. The students shouldt be using that they dont know what can go wrong. 
Im so against this creation i would not like my classmate to know how im feeling i dont care is i'm happy or sad . 
Well i dissagree 
Why should cars be limited? Theres really no reasson why. 
I belive cars should be limited to the point where people have to walk. 
The new technology which is called Facial Action Coding System should be banned because let's see if your sad or angry, you wouldnt want other people to know how you feel instead of just telling them by your own 
the author of the story says that venus is very worthy pursuit 
"With the information the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" covers, this advancement in technology seems extremely unnecessary and could potentially have negative effects even with the good intentions behind it. "
We should do this 
Sure it can be difficult but, there are many reasons why teacher-designed summer projects would work better. 
This may reflect student desires, however, it does not reflect what is best for the students education. Summer projects should be designed by teachers rather than students because it would be in the students own best interest. 
"So in conclusion I would not want to join the ""Sea Cowboys"" 
"
Many people believe that the landform on Mars was created by aliens, but here at NASA we have found that landform was actually created naturally 
I believe there is life on mars. 
The Facial Action Coding System should be enabled across the United States 
You should become a Seagoing Cowboy like me, Luke Bomberger! 
I think using technology to read the emotions expressions in a classroom is a good thing 
There are a lot of great reasons to join the program. 
I wouldnt use this Facial Action Coding System on students 
"The ""Face on Mars"" is really not a a face at all. In fact, it is simply a landform. "
If i had to write an essay arguing whether the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, it would be like this, i would say that it is really valuable 
I think students should not have to do a extra activity 
I think the reason why they have advantages of limiting car usage cause all these changes 
The face on Mars is actually just a natural landform. 
Just imagine how good of a idea this would be 
the face was just natural landforms 
I think the technologhy to read students emotional spreeions is a great idea 
In the article the author tells that even though there is alot of dangerous challenges in exploring venus and that he is willing to face them challenges. 
Luke should use these reason's to convince other people. 
I think that the use of the technolohy should not be used 
In my opinion I think that the face is a natural landform like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. 
I think its true because some computers now have facial scan recognition but they cost a arm and a leg to buy but i dont think its worth it to buy a computer that cost a arm and a leg because if something goes wrong with the computer their will be no refunds but their should be refunds because they could probably sell u a broken or damaged computer. 
All the scientist now believes that the face is an alien artifact but it is not and here is why. 
Eh, its cool, sorta but knowing me I really dont care about this facial action coding thing. I wanna find out the mood of the picture on my own. 
Even though visiting Venus could be dangerous to visit, but it would also be very interesting. Venus has a lot going on. 
I think its a good learning envoirment for the kids in grown ups . So thats some reason why I thi nk its valuable. 
I agree with the principal and most people just hang around and dont do any work 
Do you think its is a good idea to limit car usage? Well i do 
The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students is valuable 
It is just a natural landform on mars its nothing big it wasnt made by aliens 
The technology to read students emotions isn't a very useful thing. 
I am against technology being able to read students emotional expressions. We shouldn�t have computers telling exacly how our students are feeling. 
The author supports the idea of exploring venus 
that no matter how many risks just so happen to be in Venus, perhaps if we were able to get there worry free, we'd come back with things we didn't know from before. 
I think this machine could be very useful in different situations like in offices, classrooms and even in personal homes 
The author did really well by being specific and being descriptive about Venus. There was a lot of detail which made it long and a little boring. 
Students should participate in extracurricular activities because it benefits their social, mental and physical health. 
Can we go to a diffrenet planet thats what nasa is trying to figure out 
I really feel like this type of technogoly would be really helpful. 
"You should join the Seagoing Cowboys because you can have many adventures while you are doing the job. If you want to get out into the world this will be a great job for you! 
"
"Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite that dangers. 
"
Student should designed the summer project 
That is kinda funny how can a computers know when your sad or happy. Computers don't have emotions only living things do have emotions.  
First off, the technology to read emotions of students in a classroom is valuable 
Wanting to do the challege on Venus has value, has dangers, and doubts 
I disagree with schools having students participate in one extracurricular activity 
thatthe author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. 
This new, amazing and creative idea will be beneficial to everyone! Not only the students, but the entire school administration including the teachers! Even parents will profit from the outstanding new idea! 
We can't text and drive 
The fact that this tecnoligy is avalible to human kind is amizing it can be used in many ways 
"In the article ""The Challenge od Exploring Venus,"" the author states that NASA has a compelling idea to send humans to Venus to study it."" "
And yeah i dont have nothing to arguing because i think the cumputer is a good a idea for student because it can tell whether the emotions are 
"Even though scientists are aware of these difficult factors, people like the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" still think that being informed about this bright point of light is worth it. 
"
I don't think people should be able to use their phones while operating a vehicle. 
Extracurricular activities are important for students, and I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. 
So yes, this technology is very vaulable to the education of millions of students around the world who don't fully grasp their teachers learning methods or are just confused. 
"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" thinks that exploring Venus is worth the risks that are required. "
technology that tracks the way our muscles move could be used for other puposes 
I think joining in a extracurricular activity is very beneficial 
The required summer assignments should be teacher-designed by the students upcoming teacher 
there are many benifits of doing this act. At the same time there might be some small downsides to going on this trip. 
I think that having communityes without cars is great for the inviroment and if people want to do that then good for them. but i dont think i could survive with out a car 
If I was an anstronount I would love to explore venus because it would be fun to be walking on venus. 
"nemerous factors contribute to Venus�sreputation as a challenging planet to study, despite is proximity to us. 
"
The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable 
Venus is worth studying 
Students should do their own kind of projects 
The use of technology is not valuable when comes to reading emotions in classroom 
In conclusion i feel that we should just leave everything as it is in our schools 
Therefore, after reading about the Facial Action Coding System it is very benefical in many ways. 
They should not travel Venus at all to big of risk and a lot of doughts to even consider going. 
Students should not be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity 
What I have stated proves that the Face is a natural land form. It may have looked like a face in the blurred picture, but we now know that it was just a landform. 
Despite all of the troubles and challenges that Venus caused, many of the scientists, astronomers, and including the author themself think that it's worth all of the trouble to get s much information as possible to get to know more of Venus 
In my opinion parents and students should get the idea of using techonology 
I have mixed feelings about the FACS technology it could be great now but when people or robots with their own minds want to do bad or harm the people of the world this would be a great start. 
I think it would be a great idea to tell how people are feeling. 
As a NASA scientist, I'm here to tell you that these strange, yet amazing things can happen on there own. 
The first thing im gonna talk about is in the store it sayed they took there right to drive away and fined them if they do drive that is stupid. 
I believe that we should just keep our school's system the same and the school should not make someone do an unnecessary activity that they didn't want to take part in in the first place. 
The face on mars is a rock formation. No aliens made it 
I will have to say no because you can't use technology to see someone emotional. 
Venus should not be considered dangerous. 
The Facial Action Coding really helps identify human emotions 
summer projects should be teacher- designed 
Phones and Driving can be extremely dangerous. 
The technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is a wonderful idea in my opinion. 
"Schools that require students to complete summer projects should make the projects student designed, proving that there are many different ways of learning. 
"
This is what I think about the phones calls and driving is may not be clear cause there really is no answer to this question for me personally I don't care what they do or say all I care about is if our people our safe there really is no reason for people to be not allowed to have there phones in a car or make calls or answer them 
"In the text of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" it shows many dangers and reason not to put a person on this planet, yet if they succeed the outcome would be much greater and rewarding. Studying Venus is a pursuit that should be taken. "
What both countries are trying to do is limited cars so less polution. 
This technology to read and find out the emotinal expressions of students is crazy and weird. 
This machine created by Dr. Huang and his colleague prof. Nicu Sebe can impact students in ways that are good or bad. For some people it can be a good thing but for others it can mean a bad thing. 
Having Facial Action Coding System in the school, would be kinda great 
this story was about diffrent plantes and how eveything is set up also hoe everything be taveling in the earths eveviorments a ns solar systems. 
A teacher-designed project is best for the students 
This author believes that the discovery of the true venus , hidden from the naked eye, will benfit the future of science, even with the danger staring them in their face. 
In this article I would like to have the technology 
There are many resons that people should do that. 
The face is not created by aliens and here are a few reasons why. 
"Contrary to popular belief, there is nothing unatural about the supposed ""Face on Mars"". Though many would like to believe in the supernatural, this oddity is nothing but a rock formation. There are several reasons as to why the theory of aliens making this formation is preposterous, each reason stronger than the previous. "
The challenges of exploring Venus can be worthly pursuit but dangers can be presented. 
Although they have their advantages, the use of cars also has many disadvantages. 
Although many believe that these projects should be driven by the teacher, students should be the one to design these projects 
That is my argument to not be a Seagoing Cowboy.    
I think people should and shouldn't use their phones while driving. 
My answer would be yes, I think there is nothing wrong with it. 
"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author supports the idea that studying Venus is worthy but also dangerous. "
Thats why you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.  
"People are coming to the conclusion that if we, as a whole, decide to start cutting down on our usage of cars it can benefit the way we live. 
"
Venus may be dangerous but sometime it can be our nearest option for a planetary visit. 
There are many advantages to cities being able to control the amount of cars being used everyday. 
The face on mars is a natural landform. 
I believe that the use of techonology to read student emotional expression is valuable. 
summer projects should be student designed rather than teacher designed 
students completing the project would rather make it themselves than have a teacher assign the project to them. 
The face on Mars is just a natural landform 
Over the summer projects should be student designed 
some peoole want to know is other plants save to vist . 
There are many advantages to limiting car usage. 
The most ideal project is teacher-designed because a student will most likely not plan an assignment that is actually helpful or one that�prepares them for the upcoming year. 
The authoer is just saying that no matter how big the danger is, even if it is risky, we shouldn't be set back by it. 
To me I don't like the idea of the software, it can be subatage to someones art. 
Students should, 
I think yes, it can help students with their feeing 
The point of these sources are to tell you to stop pollution and stop driving cars so much. 
NASA is trying to go to the planet call Venus because is the planet that look just like Earth. 
Cell phone use while driving needs to be banned nationwide. It will not cease to occur unless people see and hear the damage it can inflict. 
First of all studying venus isn't a bad idea wanting to explore the deepest point of venus can change history and life, we can figure out many secrets that venus has and what kind of life form could be on venus because in every planet their's always something that hasn't been discovered. 
Summer projects designed by a students teacher is more effective in preserving a students learning from the previous year 
"Also another scientist are saying (am one of them) that ""It is just a rock "
I think that students having to participate in a extracurricular activity is one of the best things a school can do 
I don't like how the students have to pick what they what to do what if they don't what to do noting and I feel like they are getting focus to do something they don't what to do. 
In 1976, a photo of what was though to be a Ancient Egyptian Face turned out to be a hoax (unintentionally) and was actually just a Land formation with inclined rocks that formed a Shadow that conveyed illusions of two eyes a nose and a mouth. 
I agree that the principal should make everybody do at least�one extracurricular activity. 
The Facial Ation Coding System(FACS) is seeming to be useful in a classroom 
Cellphones should be banned while using in car. 
I personally do not think the Face is part of ancient Martian life 
I think the auther is being very un biased about wether or not we should go to venus. 
students should be the ones creating the summer projects 
Which makes that it's going to be more hard than we thought. Even though it might be more complicated we're still going to find a way. We want to know everything on Venus 
I think that if schols make kids do summer projects they should be able to pick what they are going to do 
Trust me you'll want to join 
"The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents in the article ""The Challenge Of Exploring Venus"" "
Venus can be a good planet to discver in the article it mentions that we us has human beings, havent touch the surface of Venus. The author also gives us the similarites that Venus had before Earth was around. 
I can assure you that Cydonia on mars, is not a face or anything extra-terrestrial. 
i for one most defanitly think that an atomatic face reconation system it a amazing idea 
I agree with the decision, and believe that all students should participate in an out-of-school activity 
in these passages it gives pros on the better enviormental way of living. 
Teachers should design the summer project for students 
If we limit our car usage throughout the year we can cut the rate of carbon dioxiod we produce by 1/2 
it should be known that student-designed summer projects would be better. 
You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. 
To reduce the pollution of the chemicals that cars make is to simply show citizens the advantages of limiting car usages. 
Summer projects should be teacher designed and not student designed. 
summer projects and assignments should be student designed 
now since everything is back to normal then things don't have to be bannned alot anymore so if they can keep the percentage down then evrything is good, if it does go down they can get usage, 
The advantages of limiting car usage is 
Fellow citizens need to be informed that the advantages of limiting car use could help promote better living and hope?fully a longer life span of this planet 
i think what Nick did was amazing making a facial coding system to tell what thier feeling. 
"the ""Facial Action Coding System"" is a good appications for a variety of industries because it is able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they try to hide their emotions. "
i believe that the people who are trying to go to venus or sent something to venus should do it because you never know what other kids of things are out there and if we dont try news things we wont discover new stuff . 
Yes, I believe that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit also 
Thats not smart. 
Summer projects should be teacher-designed 
student design there projects in a better way then teachers be doing because the way that teachers put there projects togeather to clarafie the way the project should be done 
I do agree with the decision of students participating in a extracurricular activity like, sports or working on a specific project or idea. Even working with council members. 
the care usage limited idea is good 
there are some advantages of limiting car usage 
If you want a really excellent job, be a cowboy in the Seagoing Cowboy program. In fact, take it from me a cowboy who rides waves. 
these summer projects should be teacher-designed 
its a worthy try even though dangerous thing happen because we never know what we could find. 
I think that participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program is not a good idea and heres why, 
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents "
In the text the outhor suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despirate the dangers it represents, which is correct. 
"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author suggetst that studing Venus is worthy but also dangerous. "
It's very worthy 
The technology would be valuable because it would allow students to focus on their assingments. 
I disagre with technology to read the emotional expressions of students in classroom . 
I agree that students should have an extracurricular activity. 
I think that having this new technology in the classrooms would be a good thing 
I would be on boat and agree to do this in schools because its not a bad idea helps us students get a better education 
However,there are some disadventages of driving car. 
I believe that the value of using technology to read students' emotional expression is important and it should be used. 
I think that the auther did a good job writtening this artivcle because he use good detail to catch the reader and to think a little more about planet venus 
Teachers, however, should design these projects 
Yes, this technology would be 100% valuable in a class room enviroment 
i agree 
All of these are ways to cut down on not only pollution but also stress.    
Having a computer that can tell what you are feeling can and can't be a good thing 
This is my opinion on being able to have a computer analyze how you are feeling. I think it would be a bad idea and it would be better off to let people keep their feelings to themselves. 
"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" mainly supports how Venus is worth the riskand challenge to explore to see if it's as much like Earth as it's said to be, "
"The lesson in this story is that ""you never know whats going to happen if you take a risk"".   "
"In this article ""Unmasking The Face On Mars"" it's just a unproven theory that its a face on mars, there is many details in this article that state that it's just a natural landforms. "
The use of this tecgnology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable 
I disagree with this technology 
I say that we use the technology that was created for helping emotional expressions of students in a classroom. 
The author did a great job supporting his/her previous statements. The author used many examples and real facts to back up the explanation of why we should keep studying and trying to get to Venus. 
You should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program it one chance oppurunity. 
I think we should use that technology to see students emotions 
There are several ways the author suggests studying venus is a worthy pursuit desite dangers along the way. 
Students should one hundred percent be the ones who plan out and create their own summer projects. 
The developement of these cars should be stopped immediately because there are too many hazardous and dangerous events that could occur. 
I am arguing against the policy change 
"I think that's crazy! If kids don't have and opportunity to play a sport because of their ""C"" that's no reason to take away their dream. What if they want to become a professional swimmer? You're just going cut down their dream tree just because of a ""c'? "
I agree 100% with you. i think in order to be on a team sport you will have to have you grade up to a B 
Our school should have a community center. 
Although many believe that students would benefit from attending classes from their homes, students would, in reality, be negatively affected by distance learning, 
"I believe you should use policy 1 allow students to bring there cell phones to school.

As long as they use them at lunch or break or any free time during the school day and have them turned off before they come to class. "
Aren't we voting for our president. innstead of countting onn the electoral votes to hep out or, go against out favor, it'd be much more easier to just let the people vote. 
I believe that we do not need to require that all students perform community service. 
That we have to do is get a B in sport or other activities 
I dont think we need driverless cars, because they would cause too many problems and be too much work to take care of. 
So we shouldn't change history we should keep the Electoral College. 
Well, me personally, i dont think its a good idea for a senator to change to that. I feel ike everyone should remain voting as usaul. 
The educational curriculum that incorporates virtual courses is providing a beneficial opportunity 
They are many thinks you can't Lerning at home you can use by way of video or online. 
community service is a nice thing to do in our community, but I also feel that you should not make children who do not have the time, or do not want to do community service have to. 
Please abandon the idea of the electoral collage. thats a childs game. It is not fair game. 
I mean it's just down right unfair to do something like that to kids who love sports. 
What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms 
I think it is a bad idea to get a driverless. 
"More cars are going to make and more style are going to make; but I also want to be safe when I'm in a car. "
I believe that the Electoral College should be changed 
It can be argued that the electoral college methods of choosing electors is bad 
Having a C average is still passing and that's what we should contemplate on, not a B average. If we eliminate the sport activity from the child it wont benefit them 
I dissagree with the fact that the state wants to keep favor of electoral college. I think they should change the way the whole election is set up by using popular vote for the presedent of the united states 
Personally I think that driverless cars are a bad idea. 
So people might say that getting rid of the electoral college is the way to go because the congress have no say in the voting. The congress is part of the political system and they should be able to have the final say on who is President. 
I think that we should change the way we vote by changing to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. I feel that this is a good idea and a good way to vote, let me tell you why. 
I don't think that it is a good idea to change the grade average to a B. 
The Electoral vote should be converted to election by popular vote 
Community service is a good thing that shouldn't be looked at like a punishment. 
The Face on Mars is a natural landform. The Face on Mars was not created by aliens 
I say that they shouldn't have to do community service if they don't want to. 
Here is my opinion about it: I do not think that students get benefit by studying in this way 
The pros for online education are very proactive to the needed change in the school system 
Why would any one want to change the electoral collage because i would like to know. In my oppinion in is the best thing i know of for a working government 
it was just a natural landform. 
I think that the online or video coferencing wounld not benefit high school student 
The face on Mars is indeed a natural landfom 
I personally believe that your first idea is the better of your suggestions. 
I do not agree with having an Electoral College for a few reasons that I can site with informational sources 
Developing driverless cars is an important part of the future of the automobile industry. Driverless cars will be safer and more reliable. 
The Faces on mars are not created by aliens 
these things is good 
I believe we should hange to election by popular vote 
Online learning may be easier than real school but in the end it leaves you at a disadvantage and unprepared for college and life as an adult. 
Driverless Cars need to be highly improved or not put onto the roads, you should always be more safe than sorry. 
i strongly believe in keeping the electoral college to be in chare of the way the elections would proceed instead of changing the outcome of elections to popular vote 
"The Electoral College has been in our Constitution since the Constitution was approved, but we have modified simple things as in gender discrimination and race discrimination, why are we not going to change this unjust system? 
"
This is a mesa it couldn't have been made from aliens becuase the way it was observed in the Jet Propulsion Lab, could not identify it as it being fake or made by aliens as some people believe it is. 
I would have to urge you to keep the Electoral College. 
I strongly believe that distance learning can make a big difference in the learning environment. 
while infact the process of the electoral college is unfair 
After researching the Electoral College process I find that the process should no longer be used. The process is not effecient for choosing the next US president and therefor the voting process should be changed to popular vote. 
I think that the school should participate in sports 
Students wouldn't benefit from taking classes at home 
Students would benefit from online school 
I have written this letter to inform you that you do not have to cancel all school sports. I think that you don't need to cancel it for all student. I think that you should have the audacity to tell everyone that the sports will not be able to be played by students that have anything below an A-C average. 
I believe that we should be able to have cell phones and be able to use them during lunch and other free time 
I dont think that the government should be in charge of everything therefore i think the people and only� people who should vote for who is the President of the United States and not vote for electors. 
I am against the development of Driverless cars 
I feel like driveless cars are a bad idea and a good idea. The reason i say this is because it can have a good outcome to it and a bad out come. There can be probles and it can solve some solutions. 
I think the electoral college should stay 
I believe that you made the correct decision. Education is very important in a students life. Being the principal, you should enforce this rule and by doing so, would improve a students future for the better. 
I do not agree with you on requiring all students to participate in community service 
I believe that there should be no more Electoral College because it doesn't give people much of a say in who becomes President because there is just a commitee of people that are voting for the President. 
"My guess would be natural landform. 
"
I think all of the kids in our community should do community service whether its with younger children or even just picking trash up along the road side.

In my opinion the electoral voting system is unfair and outdated. 
I believe that driverless cars are not a good idea. Driverless cars are not a good idea for several reasons. 
I firmly believe that we should keep the Electoral College.

I think that students should have to do community service. 
I am writing to you because it is in our best interest to abolish the Electoral College and change election to popular vote for the next presidential election. 
in my opinion the Electoral college process was established to prevent the option of President by popular vote that just dosnt seem fair. 
All schools should have the option of attending classes through online means, as it will greatly benefit students, perhaps more than attending classes in person. 
We need to put an end to the Electoral College now. 
I think we should keep our Electoral College 
A grade C average is low for participating in sports. 
I think they should be able to bring their phones just turn them off because there so many reason why they need their phone. 
I think policy 1 
"We should change the process into popular votes for the president. 
"

So yes that is why the electoral college shouldn't be removed. 
I am going to tell you two good reasons about why should community service be only for SCHOOL_NAME 
The two deciding factors in voting are the electoral college and the popular vote of the people. They both make the elections fair but also unfair. Without one the whole election process would not be as good as it is today.

Electoral College "
The electorial college system is corrupted and needs to stop being used to elect a president.

However, without it, the balance of power in America would be skewed to an unacceptable degree. States with large populations would be disproportionately empowered, without the electoral college.

I wanted to adress the positivity in keeping the Electoral College. 
it is unfair to ask that students participating in sports should have a B average. 
I am however, not in favor of keeping the Electoral College but to change it to be an election by popular vote for the president of the United States 
In my opinion, all students should perform community service. 
I feel a need to adress that changing election by popular vote for the president of the United States over keeping electoral votes is, in my opinion, better for the people because it brings the U.S's people together in many ways. 
The state senetor should keep the electoral college because of the voting previlages.

I believe that if you have a 75 and higher you should be able to play any peculiar sport you want. 
I profoundly believe that the United States should not keep the Electoral College 
The way in which a president is selected should be altered to the most popular vote because it produces a more accurate vote of the people and it provides the opportunity to directly select an individual's desired candidate. 
I am againt the development of driverless cars.

I dont know how that got there, but i'm telling you now it wasn't made by aliens

"In the article, I think that the image of the ""face"" on Mars is just a landform. "
If she has a policy where students can use their phones during lunch and nution' but during class would be great. 
I believe that allowing students to attend their classes from home would benefit students, educators, and administrators as a whole 
Allow students to have phones because students will want to use their cell phones during lunch and other free time. 
All I am trying to say is that just leave your phone in your backpack, turned off. Or just leave it at home. I think cell phones in school is a bad and good thing. But my opinion is just leave them off at home or in your backpack, turned off. 
People should agree of keeping the Electoral College because without it, countires would not have presidents or vice presidents 
I believe that we should not get rid of the Electoral College because it is a process thart some people like to take! This college had a lot of electors, 538, and to elect the president you have to have 270, and theres is more than enough electorals so why get rid of it? Each candidate running for president in your state has there on group of electors. 
in my opinion we should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United Stastes. 
I think us students of SCHOOL_NAME should have our cell phones during lunch & free period, 
"If they we'er to ask me, I would absolutly say ""Yes The Electroal College should be removed."" "
"The face is not a actual face and it is just a natural landform. 
"
There are several reasons for which I do not belive in the process of the Electoral Collage, 
I feel like driveless cars are not the safest or most reliable solution to human driver cars 
All students should be required to perform community service. 
I believe that the Electorial college should stay because without it the U.S. would get out of control with voting. 
Americans should change election by popular vote for the president of the United State 
The Election System should be changed to popular vote. The Electoral College is unfair and irratinol. It should be cancelled, and be based upon popular vote with numbers that make since.

i think its just dumb if you have to have at least a B average 
Please allow us to bring our cell phones to school. 
"It is a compromise between the election of the president by a vote in congress and a polular vote of qualified citizens for the president, as stated in line 1. 
"
It seems like a legit way of finding the right president to be in charge of our country. 
It looked like an Egyptian pharoah, but turned out to be a regular, old mesa. It is still debated whether it was created by ancient Martian life, or whether is was just another regular landform on Mars. 
Unfortunately we may not always please everyones needs because that is impossible, but it is a smart decision to maintain the U.S. president election style. 
As of now we use the Electoral Colllege method, but looking back through previous years there is evidence this method has caused some dispute. Due to these problems I suggest using the popular voting method. 
In my opinion, yes. 
By my own opinion i really consider of having the votes based off popularity and also facts

I THINK YOU SHOULD KEEP THE ELECTORAL VOTE 
"Attend classes from home by way of online can be a good idea but , in my position is not a good way for the student and can be innecesary or bad idea in many reasons. 
"
i think that you should not make students do community service to students that don't like doing it. 
If the school principal wants to change the cell phone rules , then i think it would be a better idea that she lets the students have cell phones at their lunch period and other free time but make them shut the phones off in class 
I belive that the people should get the popular vote and that the Electoral College should not be kept because it doesn't exactly help the people. 
"I believe that the

Electoral College is a good thing. "
So if i had to choose one it would be option 2 that students are not aloud to use them in school

We should keep the Electoral College for the voting of the United States. 
We should be able to keep the Electoral College because it hasn't caused any harm when it comes to electing president or vice president 
Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home

"

Eletoral college to change, to let the people vote not the congress pick any president he wants "
In conclusion, I believe, senator, that we should change our election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America.       �       �    
principle, i think students should have to do community service, 
I think there should be a little changes like they need more meetings to choose there president and the vice president how many votes are in to choose there president. 
I feel that electoral college should stay becuase it set's straight the manege for the peoples votes for the president 
Well i disagree with students having to perform community to service

I think we shouldn't get community service

I'm writing you this letter to discuss that we should keep the Electoral College. 
will kids should actually bring cell phones to school the reason 
I think the United States should keep the Elector College 
Taking classes online and at home is extremely beneficial for a student's learning 
Although virtual learning provides a more personalized learning experience for students, the consequences of implementing online classes outweigh the benefits. 
Well I think that the electoral college should stay because, its much easier then just picking a person to run the united states. 
I think it should be� the most votes each president because it should be majority rule 
I disagree on this article 
yes I think students should be required to community service 
i recomend that the electorial voting should not be changed. 
This explains the purpose of this letter, to abolish the Electoral College. I have this opinion 
I think we should keep Electoral Colleges 
Personally, I believe that for some students, learning from home may be a much more beneficial method of schooling 
I think that they should be aloud for only lunch periods and free time. 
In my opinion I believe that the Electoral College should not 
I argue in favor of keeping the Electoral college 
I think that you should have a B average and not an A average to play sports 
Driverless cars should not be developed 
I think students shouldn't have cell phones ay all because that can affect the students grade and make them repeat the same grade. 
To start off with the electoral collage should not stay and be the ones to vote for us because its we the people have the choice that we make to pick our leaders weather its the president or congressmen/women or even judges. 
Some people may think that the Face was created by aliens, but it was not. 
Changing to the election by popular vote would be a great idea 
I think you should allow us to have our cell phones on, and be able to play or use them during free time and lunch. As long as we turn the off when we are asked. 
Dear princpal i think that kid should be able to use there phone on there free time 
I think we should keep the Electoral College 
My Opinion is that they need to change Electoral College. 
"I personally do not think students should be required to perform community service. 
"
I believe that you shiould get rid of the electorial collage method and change it to the popular voting method 
Driverless cars are some what useful for us 
i think that students should perform community service it would be great for our community and should be required or mandatory for the school 
I believe that cell phones should be allowed in school at lunch time but if you have them out during class you'll receive the normal punishment. 
I do think that all students should be required to perform community service. 
"I believe that students have the right to choose what they would rather do, instead of being forced to do so. 
"
if i had to choose i would change to election vote� cause it is more popular and it has less problems unlike the other� cause when you do electoral college you have to do lots ofdifferent things that is not worth doing 
The Eletoral College should stay because this has been the system that has been used for years in the united states and i dont think that it would be respectful to the ones that have been choosen by this system. 
i think we can help this community by helping,clean,stop littering and start helping everyone so that this world can live longer then the outher worlds did 
I think online classes would not benefit students 
Changing the voting system to popular vote will give all of us that reassurance we need, such as knowing our voices are being heard. 
To me I don't think community service would be bad for us 
my guess is to not have cell phones at all or their will fail at school and in life. 
I would like a favor in keeping The Electoral College 
The face is clearly a natural landform. 
Helping the community is a great thing to do. 
so don't change the policy in till you see grades go up in too the B range. 
Driverless cars are really beneficial. 
While some say that the Electoral College goes against America's democratic ideals and it increases the probability for a disastrous vote, the Electoral College still gives Ameican citizens some sway in the election and with a completely democratic system of voting there is a good chance that the outcome could be even more disastrous. 
If we want to keep America fair and keep our pride in our country we should most defaintly start electing our presidents by popular vote,instead of relying on an out dated system that has many faults and injustce 
well i think you should only give your students community service is if they did something bad. 
My opinion on this issue is to require community service to all of the students of our school 
"The Electoral College is ""unfair,outdated,and irrational"". if the Electoral College is unfair why should should the U.S keep this process in our goverment? who really knows? But on the other hand popular votes is a great way to keep voteing fair and rattional to the U.S citizens "
I think all students should have a certain amount of hours on community service to do each week. 
"Humanity believes this land structure is a face left by aliens, we will never know. 
"
There are somethings wrong with the electoral college 
I believe we should have policy one 
"The Face on Mars is just a natural landform.

It was not created by aliens. "
I believe community service would have good looks on to our schools. 
The reason why I am writing about this is because there are a lot of things wrong with the Electoral College 
I think that my school and I should be required to do community service. I also think it should be a choice for students to say whether or not they want to do it, 
I think community service should not be a requirement ,but strongly suggest it to the students. 
While many have negative feelings, or no feelings at all, towards the Electoral College, it is a very useful force in electing the President because of its 
I think we should change the election by popular votes for the President of the United States. 
I think that the electoral college should have less power, but not be totally rid. 
I think we should have to do some kind of community work 
I feel that you should change to the popular vote for the President of the United States. 
I think that students should have a choice in this yet I can't help thinking that this would help solve problems, so i am forced to vote for this new rule. 
I think that you should let the students bring there cell phones to school and let them use it during free and at lunch 
I believe that this policy will help higher the amount of B average students because many people do enjoy playing a sport or another activity. 
I think it just a natural land form because there is no alien monument. 
I think we should be able to have cell phones in our school 
I believe that the school cell phone policy should be that all students should have their cell phones off at all times at school 
"I think that having the school do community service is a great idea! 
"
I honestely think that it should be popular vote instaed of the electoral college. i think that because its going to effect our lives, our way of living, and how our way of life is going to work. If we pick a president then thats who we wanted now what a group of people want. 
The Electoral College is an out dated sistem that we keep because the goverment wants there to be a clear winner, but we know that is not what the people the people want the right to dicide. 
"All these big name car companies are claming to have these ""driverless cars"" soon, but how safe is it going to be for states, and pedestrians on the streets? "
I think that every student should do community service 
in my opinion, i would want to keep the electoral college, 
I argue in favor of keeping the electoral college 
However, to a greater extent students would be at a loss from taking classes at home, 
"I think helping out in the community would be fun.

To me helping people out is a good way for people to get to know you.

It also helps make out world look better! "
I believe that the electoral college should be abolished. 
I think that we should be able to have our phones in school during lunch and free periods. 
Scientist found out that it was a Martian mesa and that those shadows made it look like an Egyptain Pharaoh. 
I would like to keep the Electoral College. I think it would be better for the people. 
There are both positive and negative aspects mentioned in having a driverless car. 
I think students should be required to perform community service. 
In my oppinion I think the people should vote. 
I think students�will highly benefit from atending classes from home 
This way of life should be kept up and exercised by our generation and the ones seceding us. 
If I was a scientist in NASA I would found out how did the peron face came to another planet. 
The state senator should keep the electoral college and not change it to the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. 
"My answer to that is simple ""yes "
i strongly believe that we should have Electoral vote. 
I'm in favor of the election by popular vote for the president of the U.S. 
There are pros and cons for both whywe should keep and get rid of the Electoral college 
The school policy that you have decided upon is necessary that students must have a grade B average to play sports is not a good idea in my mind. 
I argue in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states. 
The election process should be changed to one decided by popular vote instead of using the process of the Electoral College 
I agree on the position of having a system of communication for school work. 
I think driverless cars would be a very cool thing to have 
I think it fair that kids who have a B average should choose a sport but kids how have F. Should not be able to choose a sport 
I feel that we should remove the electoral college 
"
I agree with the terms that to participate in sports and other activities, that you must have at least a grade B average. Although many students have a grade C average, I think it's best to follow through with this policy. It would help students in school, as well as make the teams and activities a more stricter, nicer team. "
I think that kids should be aloud to help kid pick up litter and other things like that to help our community. 
I believe that the way of voting for a president though the Electoral College is outdated. The popular vote should be deciding who becomes president. 
I think the election system should change to most popular state votes 
In my opinion I think it is some rocks that got covered up by dust overtime 
The Electoral College shows many reasons why we should change it to popular vote. 
Well i think doing community service should be a grown ups job to do not a student or any kid in the world. 
Popular vote stands to not only correct the errors of the electoral college, but also to refine our voting system 
"I thing we should keep it because this everyones right to vote. alos it is in the constition. 
"
I think you should make community service mandatory for a few reasons. 
As a student of this school, I believe it is very necessary to require community service at our school, 
Although some may believe otherwise, students benefit substantially when they attend classes from their homes 
I mean it could have been alines but most likly not. 
I believe that keeping the Electoral College is a good idea 
Although some may think that online school or video conferencing would prevent students from acquiring important skills that one would get from daily interaction, some students would benefit from online school 
I think for the election for presidency its should be counted on the popular vote. 
I think that the rock is a mesa. 
I would want to keep it how it is. 
I believe that we should keep the Electoral college for our compromise between the election of the president. 
So I argue to keep the Electoral College to select our presidemt for the U.S. 
we should change the election by who has most popular votes for the president of the untied states 
Now if our school was known for its brains and not sports, then yes i would encourage this but it's not. We are known for our sports winning state championships in all of the sports we offer. Changing the eligibility level to having at least a B or better, could possible shoot down every thing our school is known for and why people want to come to it 
I don't think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home 
That's why i think you should make kids do community service! 
I think it is ok for kids to bring there phones to school 
Electoral College should be abolished 
Everbodys ansewer is different but my ansewer is to abolish it 
I think the Electoral Collage is unfair to the citizens of the United States of America. 
Community service is very important. 
I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. 
The Electoral College is something that should be kept for our government voting system. 
"I argue that online school is not as benefical to a student; instead, online classes can wind up being detramental to a students development and education. "
I think students should be tasked for community service rather at a high school than rather a middle school 
I believe policy 2 is a good choice for a cell phone policy 
"Due to its many benefits, driverless cars are a positive additon to our society. 
"
I believe that Electoral College is the easist way to handle the way of voting. Any ways whats wrong with Electoral College almost half the people agree to it. 
I believe that community service is the right thing to do 
I think that letting students bring cell phones to school is a good idea. We should be able to let the students use them at lunch time and any other free time we have. 
I think you should make the community service an elective for the 8 grade students 
I feel like we should keep the Electoral College 
This is why the United States needs to keep the Electoral College instead of switching to the popular vote for the elections. 
In my opinion you should just leave the Electoral college system the way it is. 
What I favor is changing electoral college to election by popular vote. 
Dear state senator i am writing to you because i would like to try a different way to select the president by using the popular. 
I infact am not for Electoral College or changing election by popular vote. 
In the end, there was not evedience of alien lifeform or artcraft. What we predicted might not be right, but it's defenitly not a sign of alien life. 
We should keep the Electoral College instead of changing it. 
In my point of view I think that it does because it gives certain reasons to show it does and if it didnt work the would've changed it a long time ago so it shows you that it work and thats why its still around until this day 
Well i choose election because the election is a better way of letting the oters express their ideas. 
the electoral college should be changed 
I am strongly against driverless cars. I feel that whoever came up with the idea must have had some bad food or something. I wonder what encouraged them to even have the thought of a car driving itself. Having driverless cars will most likely end the human population. I am saying this because it makes me think of the movie Wall-e. 
I on the other hand, am fine with it. What people fail to see is that because of the electoral college , is that everything is going great, 
The electoral college was established by our founding fathers, and still benefits us today. Using trusted representatives and efficently casting the desired vote, the electoral college is the best method of selecting a president 
The policy of students not being able to participate in sports or other activities unless they have B average is a praiseworthy one because it encourages students to soar academically. 
I think this is a very fair method to use and that we should most definetly keep it. 
It should be popular votes take all. 
In the ruels of voteing there should be change. 
I think that you should choose Policy 1 
While many may argue for it, the Electoral College has proved to be an obselete way of electing the President. 
I believe that allowing student to bring phones to school and using them during lunch period and free time but as long as the phones are off during class time is a bad idea 
I think that student have a b average. I believe that they should have a C or B average to play sports 
I fully agree and support this idea. 
Yes i think it fair to say that because i think every student can make a B or a C to play any kind of sports that they want to play 
Driverless cars are the next, new future. 
he said that a alien put it there i said impossible. 
It is not fair that something like that could star to thake place in the United States. This country is for the ones that are looking for freedom to have the right to argue their way of thinkind and express, in a good way. 
You should keep the electoral colleges because people are not only voting for president but are also voting for a slate of electors 
"With advancing technology and better processes, the old ways of doing things must be questioned. 
"
Do you know the saying if it is not broken don't fix it well the Electoral college is that system america has use this system for so long and they aren't the type of people for change that fast, 
This letter is to inform you of the idea of requiring students to perform community service. Community service is a good was to show others how our school wants to help out in our community. 
I believe that Driverless cars are going to be a very important nessesity to the development and transition of transportaion technology. Transportation will change from getting to places by using your own brain, to getting to places without having to really think about what you are doing while you are going somewhere. 
I think that students should be do community serves, but not too much only. probably only like one hour or tow. 
I believe that the Electoral College should be kept, 
Online school is an innovative idea that makes it easier for students of all backgrounds and situations to learn with their peers without missing a beat 
I believe that policy 1 is a great idea 
Hello, I am writing to you about the Electoral College and why that I think it should be removed 
I see absolutely no point in the Electoral College 
I don't think it is fair to the students that play sports to have just an B average, i think it should be at least an C average because some students are better in some subjects than other students and by taking that away you are taking away all some kids know 
"There are too many ""what ifs"" with a driverless car for me to feel safe to ride in one, or to even have one driving on the street around me. "
I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the United States. 
I would go with policy number one because something might come up that day at school and the student might need to tell a parent what happened. 
I believe that having time to use our cell phones is prior to our learning. 
We should keep the electoral college 
In all honestly, getting rid of the Electoral College is for the best. 
Dear senator i think that you shuled change to people vote then a Electoral college. 
As a firm believer in this, I would ask you to consider that all students of SCHOOL_NAME take part in community service. 
I disagree with the idea of only letting students with B grade average or higher only being allowed to participate in schools sports. 
The driverless car in my opinion should just stay away from the roads 
I am writting this letter on behaf of my feelings on changing the election by popular vote. 
The electoral college is a fraud, 
We should keep the Electoral College 
Senator, we should keep the Electoral College. The Electoral College establishes judgement and fairness by giving upcoming presidents a fair shot. People have voices and the popular vote can be biased from state to state. 
I think students would benefit from being able to take online classes at home, rather than at school, 
we should be able to chose to do that work 
After reviewing information about the Electoral College, I believe that the Electoral College should not be used in deciding or electing the president of the United States. 
I vote yes that we should keep the electoral college in. 
"It is a great idea letting the students use there phones during lunch or free periods that gives the students a feeling of trust from the school.

"
On my Opinion i think is a good way to the student that they can take classes on online or on video chat is a good way to do it 
As far as the new policy goes I disagree because i feel everybody should be able to participate in activities 
That's great to some students learning option to take some class in home, 
I think that you should think of allowing students to bring phones to school and let them use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. 
Principal such not do this become most students have c' s in there class 
I believe that we should not keep the Electoral College because i feel as if it would be easier for people to vote somore people would actually vote. 
I think that our president's should be chosen by popular vote 
Dear, Principal I think students at our school should be required to do community service. There are many reasons they should do community service. 
Dear senatoris it posible for you to change the electoral college to election by popular vote for the president of the united states because its better. 
No I think that the Electoral College does not work, 
I think that students shouldn't be able to have cell phones at school at all 
I believe that most students should volunteer in community service. It really could help the world we live in today. 
I believe that we should get rid of  the electoral college system 
Which is why I believe that Policy 2 is the right choice. 
The Electoral College has been well working for many year and think that we shouldn`t change it because it been an well know process for elections for the pasted years of our country`s history. 
"Electoral College voting should not be the way we vote for something so important. 
"
I believe students shouldn't have to do community service if they don't want to. 
I believe we should keep the Electoral College 
First i want to say that i agree and disagree with your decision. 
I agree with requiring the students to do community service. 
In my opinion, this change is immensely unfair to the student body, will cause disarray among the different clubs, and will hurt the school much more than it will aid the school. My understanding is that you are considering this policy change so that students will work harder to retain a B average and so the student body will improve, however, you must also consider the numerous possible negative consequences. 
"The majority of the popular vote in the united states should determine who sits in the

White House "
I think it is a good idea for the student's to be in community service. 
that all the students should be willing to perform community service in some way. 
I personally feel that the electoral college is just plain unfair 
then there is no reason that semi-autonomous cars should not replace the commercial vehicles that we see today. 
I think students who have less than a B average should be able to do sports, because doing sports teaches us students responsibility, and self discipline 
So in conclusion the Face on Mars is just a naturel land form created by god when he made the universe. 
"This system has stood the test of time, however it has masked its flaws for long enough. ""60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" (Plumer 9). The people have spoken, "
What Would Our Country Yet The World Be Like With Driverless Cars ? Having Driverless Cars Would Have Both Positive And Negative Aspects 
a direct election would be much better 
Our presidential campaign will be much better if we change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. 
Online Classes are not a good option for students 
The electoral college seems to have worked for all these years , but my opinion on this is that we should change it to electing a president with popular vote. There are many pros and cons to both the electoral college and the popular vote but the positives of the popular vote outweigh the negatives more then the electoral does. 
I think we should make everyone do community service! 
Almost everyone has phones, and in my opinion phones should not be allowed to be used at school. 
My opinion on driverless cars is that it is a good development. 
I would argue that they are not. Cars have been around for about a hundred years, and not once has society put its foot down and demanded a car that drives itself. 
According with the test, i agree because all the candidates generally hace responsabilities 
These are just some reasons why i think the presidential should be replaced by popular vote. 
This is why I believe we need to invest in building public infrastructure, public cars, and other forms of transportation. 
I think we should be aloud to use cell phones during free periods 
Although, I am claiming to be on both sides of this situation, it may be that I would never purchase this type of car 
"
I strongly believe that the electoral college is the right way to go. "
I would like to keep the Electoral College because i think it works out better than the popular vote. 
After all this was no formation by aliens it was simply a formation from the planet itself. 
I personally don't like this thing. that is because it is so outdated and unfair. 
If you ask me i think regular cars are better. I also think driverless cars are dangerous. 
Some school districts now permit their students to learn and participate in class via internet or video conference. While this innovation may seem like a peek into the future of American schools, it is not without its share of faults. 
Students would benefit from from distance learning through online classrooms or video conferencing 
The Face on Mar couldn't been made by aliens. 
I personally do not agree with the choice you are considering. 
In my opinion i think that students should do community service for many reasons. 
I think we should change the election by popular vote 
I think that it is just Mother Nature, she put it like that, that spot is a natural landform. 
This is a the start of why I think Electoral College is fair and equal all around. 
Policy one is the right one to do 
I dont think that the electoral college should decide the president of the united states, i think that the overall vote of the americans should determine the president of the unites states. 
The electoral college is unfair in many ways, 
I would like it if you would just keep the Electoral college because it would be so much easier to pick a president then if we the people had to pick the president 
I think we can keep it, But improve it. 
I think the principal should require community service. 
I don't care what google does for driverless cars, I think they may be good for a small town such as Berne, but there are a lot of cons to this whole issue. I think it would be fun to have cars we don't have to drive ourselfs but an issue with that is what if we do get into an accidnet in a bigger city. I'm nuetral on this topic because they aren't truly driverless ars if they still need a driver. 
They should keep the Electoral college, 
I would love it if the electoral college was gone 
I am against the use of driverless cars. 
in the case of nationally voting to decide our vital political figures, such as the President and Vice-President, the ballot of the Electoral College is not giving the voters of America a fair result when it comes to the final moments of a presidental election. 
The Face of Mars is only a Natural Landform that has been around Mars since it was created. 
The Electoral College is not perfect and it may be called broken by some people, but in all truth it isn't. 
so I think we should at least vote to it. 
That should stay remain the same they should not be any change to the Electoral College system. 
The Electoral College was a smart idea in the seventeen and eighteen hundreds, but as our country continues to change, it is necessary to change the way that we elect our leaders. The Electoral College has remained untouched and exactly the same for hundreds of years and this has caused it to be extremely outdated. 
"I agree in favor yo keep the

Electoral College "
"A popular vote should instead be utilized to fairly choose the people of power in this country and would better represent voters' opinions. 
"
Allowing students to use cell phones at school is alright as long as you don't use them in class 
I believe that changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average is a bad decision. 
"Because of these specific examples, I believe that driverless cars will be extremely important in America's future and greatly benefit our use of transportation. 
"
I think driverless cars are still a thing of the future and not present. 
I say that we keep the electoral college because it was the way that the founding fathers found out how to balance out how the peope should decide. 
So, as you can see, I am of a spilt mind as to what I want you to do. 
"The US should just remove the winner take all system and replace it with 'proportional representation"" to preserve equality and functionality. "
Hello, Mr. Senator i'm writing this letter to you because i'm in favor of keeping the Electrocal College. 
I think the Electoral College should be brought down and let the popular vote decide who the president of the United States will be. 
I think it isn't a very good idea for it to be mandatory to perform community service. 
I think the idea of every kid having to do community service is a great idea. 
Is it not time for a change in the Electoral College? 
I completely support this plan. 
I favor in changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states. 
The Electoral College should be abolished and replaced by the popular vote system 
This is where we find the reason behind the face of Mars! 
Students should be allowed to obtain cell phones during school hours, and also be allowed to use them during free periods. 
The President of the United States should be chosen by popular vote 
"doesw the electoral college work?

yes the electoral college works "
I agree you should keep the Electoral College because it a has a major impact who gets elected 
Policy one: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off. 
Keeping the Electoral College would greatly benifit our country.� The electoral process is a very important process that is needed. 
Therefore the face is just a landform with shadows that make it look like a face. 
I think we should change to election by popular vote because so that everyone can vote, 
I stand with the makeing of these cars and the possiblities that come with in our society. The cars would be able to open new doors to health benefits, lowering crash ratios, and much more. The driverless car would be a great achievement in human curisosity and invention. These cars would better many different levels of society if made and used propely. 
"it is just a natural made landform. 
"
So, i mean there are many good things about it and many bad things you just have to be smart about what you do 
However, not all people would want to do this. I personally think that community service is a volunteer job and that people of the community should do it at their own free will. Depending on what type of services the students would provide would vary the response in enthusiasm. My opinion to community service would be that every one needs to do their share in helping. 
The students of your school as well as I think you should go with policy 1 and allow cell phones during lunch and free times. 
"The Electoral College needs to be abolished, so that the peolpe of the U.S.A can vote on the president for real. People want a derect vote not just to sit and watched the peoson that they voted for not get elected becuase of a College that has all the ""power"" "
The electoral college needs to be kept, it is the easiest way to vote for a presidential canidate 
I think students would benefit doing school at home 
The Face on Mars is actually not a face but a natural landform 
I think changing to election by popular vote should chose the president of the united states. 
Changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United State is the best way to select the prisedent, because people has right to pick any prisedent for them selve. 
I think the policy should allow us to have cell phones. There are certain reasons why. 
Coming in the next few years, driverless cars offer a safer, smarter, and more effective way to travel. 
Aliens wouldnt make a face on mars 
I strongly believe that changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United State. 
I think that students should go perform community service. 
If I were you, I would let the students choose for them selves. 
I favor keeping the Electoral College in the arguement. 
I think that the Electoral College is a bad way of picking a president, because as Americans , we have the freedom of speech and that should include voting as well 
"I think you should change the whole ""

Electoral Collage

"" and have election by a popular vote instead. "
I disagree because, one all most every kid loves their sports if its watching it or doing it. 
The Electoral College provides certainty of outcome and avoids run-off elections and should be kept as the form of election of the U.S. president of our state. 
I Believe that cell phones need to stay at home 
i agree with both policy but if i have 2 chose it will be policy # 1. 
I beleive citizens should vote for there president so they can have a right on who to vote on 
I argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. 
"The ""Winner-Takes-All"" system is flawed and needs to be either fixed or completly taken down, and here are two reasons why "
"
I think that you�should keep the Electoral College because people want to vote for who they want as president "
I believe that performing community service would be a great idea 
I do not agree on how the election is happenening or how it is run. It is very unorganized and not very fair. 
Students should take community service 
It is not fair for the electors to elect the president. 
we should keep the elctoral college. 
And that what I think principal so please don't change the rules. 
I think Policy 1 would be a better policy then Policy 2 
My opinion is that we be able to vote saying the most popular votes win because why would we give are opinion and stating it if it doesn't matter 
Although some students will miss out on the opportunity and experience of physically being present at school and going through their day with their fellow classmates, many students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home 
I do not think that students should be required to do community service. I believe that it should be a choice but only under certain circumstances. 
The electoral college needs to change 
maby when i right this all down he will change his mind. i hope so. 
"Although some believe�with help the of online or video conferencing�students would benefit less from being able to attend classes from home, it should be known that�with the help of online or video conferencing�students would benefit more from being able to attend classes from home. 
"
I believe that election by popular vote for the president of the united states is the smartest and easiest way to go about things. 
If you change school policy and make it so that students can't participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a B average, you are preventing students from being their best at what they do or in other words, being knowledgeable in their activity. 
i think that we should keep the electoral college 
I think you should allow us students to use cell phones during lunch 
"We are attempting to prove that it is natural. 
"
I would like to take this time into explaining why having the Electoral College is not a good idea in determining who would become our president. 
I think that students ought to have there vote in the situation because why would you make people do something they don't want to do. 
In my opinion I think there should be a reason why some of the students want to do community service and not others. 
I am in favor of changing to election by a popular vote for the president of the United States. 
The Electoral College is very unfair, and should be subject for abolishment 
I don't think the landform is an ancient artifact or any alian artifact i just think its a normal landform that happens to look like a human or alian face. 
I have came to the conclusion that we should keep the Electoral College. 
The electoral college is tradition and shouldn't be changed 
I belive that we should change the election to a popular vote for the president of the united states. 
I think we should keep the electoral college 
Well if you haven't Is really just a landform 
I think that we should ude the popular vote for the president of the United State 
The opinion of people is that is a good form of meeting a President and Vice President the reason for is good an electoral college is because having of discussion the work and� your can see from who vote. 
I think it would be a good idea to offer community service but I do not think it should be mandatory. 
It should be upheld for it's ability to produce a solid outcome, and though it has the possibility of failing it's faults are not worse than the popular vote system 
"This fair system allows representation of the people's will, just like the rest of our government does. 
"
I think that they should keep the electoral collage because the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. 
Yes i think the students are benefit 
I think they can attend to do it at home to finish their assignment 
Well people should pick up litter and i am going to tell you why: 
Although some disagree, students would benefit from attending classes at home 
"After reading the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" i have came to the conclusion that i am against these vehicals. "
I personally believe that not only our state, but our nation would be better off using the Electoral College voting. 
The electoral college is just a waste of time 
I think that what you are doing is wrong. Students should not be obligated to do community service if they do not want to. 
We should work to abolish electoral collage, not just you and me but everyone in Florida and even in the united states. 
i believe that we should keep the electoral college 
I think it is a great idea to help the community 
Due to the fact that we live in America, where we have the choice of choosing what we would like to do, (most of the time), I due believe that students should have the right to choose weather or not they want to participate in community service 
"I think that the principal should choose Policy 2. 
"
I think it would be a bad idea if the school district and your self would allow everyone to bring there cell phones to school , even if there turned off during class 
My position on driverless cars is they would be more of a positive affect in the world. 
and i think that policy 1 is a good idea 
I think that they should not be on the streets. Stating my opinion and further explain I think that they will never get to a point full reliablity. 
I am against the ideal of driverless cars. 
Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home 
Overall I believe that we should change the Electoral College. 
Yes i think yes its can by a benefit to attend classes from home 
i think we should do community service don't you? 
It is unfair to not allow students to participate in after school activities if the student doesn't get at least a B average. 
Honestly sir/ma'm i think that it would be way better if we just changed our election on popular vote instead of having it as an electoral college. 
"Even, after reading the passage, I don't believe that driverless cars should be a reality right now.

Maybe in a few years, when changes are made for safety precautions, but in the now, we can handle driving on our own. "
There are many things that can benefit from community service, there are also many things that can not be beneficial. 
I don't want to keep the Electoral College I want to have Election by popular vote for the next president. 
Well, I think that students should have community service because it will help people and make them feel happy. 
I don't think it is right for you to change our school policy 
I would say that we keep the Electoral College because it has worked over the past century so why change it now. 
In my opinion, i think you should make all students perform some type of community service. 
To me I think we should change the election by popular vote for the president 
I think you should allow students to have cell phones in school. 
Dear, state senator I think we should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States 
I as a student here at your school do not think students should be forced to do community service 
I think that policy 1 is better because when you have free time what will you do? 
the electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. 
I think that they should keep the electoral college because they are many electors that vote for president and they alsio vote for canidates, so theres no reason they should take out the electoral college. 
I honestly think driverless cars are an unproductable invention and can cause danger. 
Mr. senator i think we should get rid of the electoral college and change to popular votefor the presidency. 
You should keep the electoral college vote the same without the popular vote 
The Face isn't an alien artifact. It wasn't created by aliens, it's just a natural landform on Mars. 
We should be changing to the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. 
In my opinion, I think it's a better way to handle things than to just ask everybody to cast their votes for just one person. 
"In this essay, I will be showing how the face on Mars is just a plain everyday landform. 
"
I think that all kids should do community service to make their lives and the community a better place. 
i think that we should cape the electoral college process 
Do you think that the FACE was created by aliens ? Well i think the face is just a land form but thats how i feel about it 
You may think that the face on mars was created by aliens and we say it isn't it's a natural landform sorta like some natural landforms on Earth like the Grand Canyon it's a natural landform 
I would have to go with electral college because better who would want a rich person voting last 
The Electoral College is broken, and with another election on the way, here is why the voting should be changed to popular vote for the president of the United States. 
So I think that people should stop driving so reckless and start paying attention to the road 
Policy 1 is a good considering policy 
You should consider policy #1 because most kids use their cell phone no matter what the rule is. 
The development of driverless cars would be an amazing in incredibly helpful step for society and the car manufacturing world. 
I think we should in take concideration in the next few years about changing are election to popular vote. 
The electrol college system is an unfair system, people don't have the right to select their own president, they dont have the right to select a president. 
I thinkl that you should keep electoral college 
Let the people vote for the person they want to not the electoral collage. I agree that the electoral collage should be change. 
The Electoral Collage sould be discarted and Presidents of the united states should be elected by popular vote. 
What else could it be, all evidence points to nothing except a common mesa. 
"I think you should let us students that have a

D

should play sports. "
I disagree with student having to have a grade B average to be able to participate in school activities 
Its not a alien its just how the landform was growing 
I think that driverless cars sound pretty cool. People don't need driverless cars though. 
Driverless cars is a good and bad idea, its cool but it could still be dangerous. I think they should not make driverless cars because we don't need them when we can drive on our own. 
I think that we should do the electoral college, 
I understand your reasoning for the new change you would like to undertake, but I am against his issue. Many students in our school love to play sports, and other fun activities, but also many students are getting C averages or below as their grades 
I argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College 
Driverless cars have a positive and negative aspect to them. 
In my opinion policy number one is the best decision that you could make regarding the students. 
"The Electoral College is not what it used to be, its not the most effecent way anymore. The people should decide this time, I am not saying get rid of it. But we should change it. 
"
Dear Senator I am not in favor of keeping the Electoral College. We should not keep the Electoral College for many reasons. 
you should stick with the electoral college 
The face on Mars is just a landform 
I do not think you should make it mandatory for everyone to do community service for a few reasons. 
I agree with policy 1 because student should get to bring their cell phones to school. 
The school should go with policy 1. 
The Electoral College is an outdated system of voting. There are few weak reasons why it should be carried out as the nations voting process. The United States of America should change to election by popular vote for the presidency. 
I think the Electoral college shall stay put. 
I think that diverless cars shouldn't be allowed on public roads because they are not safe. 
I think it would be a good thing for us teens to do community service 
A better idea for you change is that the students should have a C in the first semester to participate in sports and other activities. Then in the second semester the students must have a B to participate. 
After 18 long years we finally reveled it as a natrual landform. We proved that through pictures. Its hard to argue with that. 
I think that we should be able to use our cell phones during lunch periods and other free time 
I think that keeping electoral college would be a great idea for many reasons, we have had the electoral college for many years now and it has been great it has many good benifits to it. 
But there was no type of alien that made all those faces 
Some people might think that doing community service is mindless and stupid, but i think it's a great way to help people who don't have a well planned out education or who don't have a house or just cleaning up the environment. 
I think that we should not have it beacause it's just to much. 
I think that we should not change the way we vote we should keep the Electoral College 
Community service, you want children to do community service my opinion for that is they should in some way and in another they shouldn't . 
In this essay I will discuss why cars are the future and thus, why I support them 
So overall Bob dole was right abolish the electoral college!       � 
I am very one sided with the way I feel about driverless cars. I feel that driverless cars are dangerous and hazardous. 
Everything is put to rest with the qulity of the new picture showing better textures and a clear image of this biome. 
You do, well let me tell you something it was not made by aleins it was made by comets they hit mars and they made the face because aliens are not real they are fake, so they coundn't of made them. 
"Under the Electoral College, it is entirely possible for a Presidential Candidate to win presidency, even with the majority of voters voting for the oposing candidate. We should discard the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote. 
"
I think that when picking the president that the people of the united states should be the ones to pick instead the electoral college makes the choices of who we get for president. 
Each favor has its advantages and disadvantages, but we should favor in keeping the Electoral College 
i think that why would you have the electoral college when you can just vote some other way insted of having this big thing just to elect the presidant and the vice presidant why can't you just have a regular meeting deciding if you are voting for that presidant and the vice presidant the electoral college to me makes no sense why would you have this big thing that makes no sense at all 
"I think that you should help change the way we vote. In my opinion, its complete nonsense that this ""Electoral College"" process is used "
personally, i don't think community service should be required 
I believe that the policy of having at least a B average to participate in school sports or activities is the correct thing to do 
I would want you to keep The Electoral College the same for its been up to Congress and popular votes from the citizens to elect the President and Vice President all this time. If we change The Electoral College , we might end up having to change a few more things. 
the Electoral College are not making votes fair for other people 
Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO have all agreed on abolishing the electoral college, and so do I! 
But students should help out the community. 
Many would seem to object to the thought of having to maintain a B average to participate in sports, but I for one, agree. 
"
But know that you know some people in America don't like the Electoral College and saw what they had to say mabye just mabye you will consider changing how we the people ofAmerica vote to choose who we want in the White House.    "
There are many reason why Electrol College should not be kept, but it is the right thing if we change it to election by popular vote 
I�think that students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home 
I'm a scientist at NASA and the Face, a lot of people seem to think was formed by aliens or is proof of alien life forms, is actually just a natural landform 
Having the option to attend class at home has many benefits for students, and would help to raise many students GPA's, due to the flexibility that the distance learning would offer. 
The development of the driverless car is a good thing 
But what I think you should do is change the electoral college as it is now. You want to kno why well here I will tell you what I think you should keep it. 
Well i think that we should use phones but if anyone sees tell people to put there phone away. 
I reconsider that are principal should let us eight graders bring are cell phones to school and allow us to use them at all time except during class. 
It looks more like a rock or a mesa not something made. 
Online classes are not as beneficial to students as classroom learning 
"This system of eletor votes is very useful for picking the country's leaders. 
"
However, even though there have been a few problems in the past about this system, the Electoral College is still the best method of voting. 
So with the electoral college method, i think it should be abolished. 
I think that doing community service is a good thing and every one should do it, 
The Electorial College should be abbolished. 
"Attending classes from home relieves school of its contributions to an individual, reminding us that the authenticity of a school institution cannot be replaced. 
"
I belive that we should change the way presidents win the election. I dont think it sould be based on what the House of representatives and Senators think. It should be based on popular vote by the citizens. After all, isn't about what the people want. 
I feel the need to eliminate the Electoral College process of voting and just have a regular election where the President with the most votes wins, as simple as that. 
that we should change the election by popular vote for the president of the united states. 
All student should participate in some form of community service. 
I would like to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. 
I believe it would be a good idea to keep it, I mean why would you change something that still works?� Now unless you want to make it a better process it should stay the way it is. 
I think the United States of America should change or abolish the Electoral College 
I think that the Electoral College is not fair to American's. We all need to be able to select as who we want as the president of the United States. 
With all do respect i dont think having the electoral college is a proper way to nominate a president, or any senate for our country. 
I think i would vote to do community service 
With the popular vote people are actually getting what they voted for. 
I propose that we shall keep the Electoral college in order to keep things fair amoung the country. 
I think students should be required to take a position on whether students should be required to perform community service 
I think that YES our school needs to do community services 
Student's will greatly benefit from being able to attend classes from home 
The Electoral College is flawed to the point where the most logical way to vote would be to base presidental elections off of popular votes. 
Im in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States for a couple of reasons 
I think in my opinion students should do that and work from home 
Dear senator I am arguing to you in favor of keeping the Electoral College for the voting process of the president. 
I think handling elections by popular votes is a much more resonable way of dealing with election. 
Policy 2 would be better because if you can have cell phones out during school it is distracting you from what you are learning. 
I would want to keep the Electoral College 
The electoral college should be disbanded and reiterized by popular vote 
I belive the electoral college should be abolished as a process over all. 
There are alot reasons to keep our the despised method of choosing the President. 
I would try to do better in school so I would be able to play sports. 
I think the electoral college is a fantastic method of electing the United States of America's president 
I think we should get a new system as well 
I am not in favor of the electoral college 
The idea of driverless cars is impractical and shouldn't be taken seriously. 
I think you should use policy 1. allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as the phones are turned off during class time 
I think that driverless cars should continue to be developed 
Community service, i believe, is a great way to help people who need assistants and it helps us become better people 
I don't think we should do community service 
My opinion is that you should change the election to the popular votes. 
We should change the system were people can vote for there president not there state electors. 
"The use of driverless cars, or at least almost driverless cars, will be benificial to the future as less accidents will happen, preventing more casualties. 
"
Driverless cars can be very useful to people today. 
i don't think you make kids do community services for a number of things. 
really thier is no need for the Electoral College 
I believe Policy 2 would be a better decision 
Students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home 
"I think that Ms. TEACHER_NAME

should let us have community service "
I think it's a good idea to put more control on the car and less for the driver that has to drive the car. 
Students should not be required to do community service because it's unfair for the students who don't want to clean or pick up trash 
I still don't believe aliens was the cause of this unique landform. 
I think that they shouldn't change to popular vote in the United States because the electoral college is more fair and plus they don't know the outcome of the election of the popular votes of the prsident of the United States. 
know that community service is a good thing to do but we also need to look out for ourselves. We have schoolwork that needs to be completed, extracurricular activities to do, and chores back home that need to be completed, we just wouldn't have enough time! 
When this happens, distance learning could be utilized to continue covering the curriculum in a timely fashion. While distance learning has its benefits, it should only be used in extreme circumstances 
I believe that the election for our president of the United States should be chosen by popular vote and not by some random people we don't know 
I believe that choosing the president of the United States should be choosen by popular vote and not by the Electoral Collage 
"I am in favor of changing the process in which America votes for its president; "
when distance learning is applied to hard working students, it allows for significantly better results more consecutively, making it way more effective than the current system set in place. The reason for its better performance is because of two aspects: 
The electoral college should continue to help citizens vote for campaign runners role in the community because it provides the citizens a choice and also a voice. 
So, me Henry and many other NASA scientists look into it and we figure out this is not a face 
Even though you may believe that keeping the electoral college is a great idea and a benefit to all, its not. 
The Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote, 
Dear State senator , You should keep the electoral college 
I disagree with the Electoral College and believe we, the voters, should be souly responsible for determining our President. 
I would personally prefer Policy 1, because if the students are responsible then they should be able to use there phones in free time such as lunch hour. 
"Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

yes and no "
I think is the electoral college is important 
I think you should go with policy 1. 
i think that it has some big issues and the neagtives overcome the positives 
Going to school gives you a lot of benefits 
I think that we should keep the electoral college. 
I think every student should be prerequisite to do at least two hours of community services. 
So why do we need to cange the way we do things. 
It would be best to require students to perform community service. 
I think that students should be able to perform community service 
I think you shouldn't put everyone in community service 
The electoral college denys that right and that is why the state senator should change that. 
I believe that children should be allowed to bring their phones to school, therefore I support policy one. 
I THINK THAT PEOPLE IN THIS SHOULD HELP THE COUNTRY ON DOING THE RIGHT THINGS LIKE DOING RECYCLING. PICKING UP TRASH. 
I myself do not think that students should be forced to do community service because community service is something that people should want to do. 
I think our school should keep performing community an service, because it's a fun and good task, and most kids at different schools don't get the opportunity to experience community and service day. 
After many years of no one has changed anything else about the election camagign or anything. I think its time to do that. Lets put a girl in the office she can do just as good as a men. 
We shold have community service for those student that don't clean up there own mess. 
I think the the Electoral College is a very irrational way to elect our presidents of the untied states of America. It might have been effective when it was first created, but now it dosent seem like it can work out anymore. 
we as a nation should keep the electoral college vote 
we should keep awere electrol college 
Self driving cars are the future of transportation as the offer a host of positive benefits 
I think students would not benefit being able to attend classes from home 
I think you should� change the election by popular vote for the presiden of the united states because then the people would choose who they like better and it would� easyer to vote . 
"In the past years our country has been run by a ""electoral college"" voting system. Has always been the soultion to our (america's) equation. Its been in bussines since 2012 now and so far has seen no problems. Our country has a strong base an voting system for our country period . "
Even after proven wrong, people are still thinking that the face on mars is an actual alien made face. 
When pepole say that the face on mars was created by aliens they are wrong 
I believe that the Electoral College puts a restraint on the freedom our people, new and old, should possess. 
I'm here to talk to you about keeping the electoral college 
There are many reasons why the voting process should be changed to popular vote instead of the Electoral College. 
"All these things are reasons why I believe that ''face on mars'' is a natrual landform. 
"
just because students have C' s doesn't mean that you yourself should keep them from what they want to do 
I beleive that you should consider voting against the electoral college. Now you may ask why, but, I assure you that the electoral college is a way for corrupt presidential candidates to win the office and make this great nation a horrible place. 
We should remove the system of the Electoral College because it is questionable, problematic, and does not represent well our democracy. 
I deeply support the fact that community service does the world a lot of good. 
I think we should keep the electoral vote. 
I think we should keep our method of choosing our state president 
I think that the Electoral College should be removed and replaced with popular vote only. It would make elections more fair, and it would make peoples' votes feel like they change something. 
"I believe that rather than having the

Electoral College , we should have elections by popular vote "
I think that the second policy is better because students shouldn't have phones during class or on free time. 
"students would not benefit more as opposed to learning from an actual classroom setting in a school building, especially when thinking about the resources and skills that schools can teach and offer. 
"
In my honest opinion I dont even think that we should have a President. Presidents dont do anything other than make things worst for our country. 
Driverless cars has many positive aspects, but lets focus on the negative outcomes. 
Congress should change the election by popular vote for the president of the Unites States. 
you should choose policy 1. 
I am personally against the policy that states that a student has to maintain a B or better average to play a sport or participate in activities. 
I think it is a good idea to make students do some community service. 
dear state senitor I humbaly suggest that you don't turn from electoral college 
We should go with changing to election by popular vote for president 
"This ""face"" is just a natural landform. "
Driverless cars are the new future to this planet and in technology. There needs to be a new and improved way to drive cars, even if the driver does not need to touch the steering wheel. 
I believe that students should be able to play sports with a C average 
The reveal was a natural landform and not alien artifact after all 
"my position on driverless cars is that cars should just be left alone. 
"
Driverless cars would be a postive, efficent, and a improvment in the world, 
i argue you that we keep the electoral collage because of its many pros 
I personally think that there should be an electoral college vote 
In my opinion, Im in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. 
I think that we should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America 
Electoral College is not a good idea for us citizens. Because everybody in this country that works and come from another country , should be able to vote for their President. 
I think your decision on whether all students on doing community service should be a yes. 
it was really just a landform 
The Electoral College was created with good intentions, but it has many vital flaws which allow for very unfair outcomes. The electoral college is an outdated, and irrational way to choose the president of our country for the next four years 
I think that it should be mandatory for all students here at school to do these good acts upon or society. 
we should keep the Electoral College 
Take learning distance on home is not good ideas 
Some people planned on abolishing it, I think thats and i'll show you why. 
We should make a change in our goverment and make elections by popular vote 
I, PROPER_NAME, think it is best to keep the electoral colles, but here is why. 
And those, if the very few, who do get it, are opposed. They would prefer another system, a more modernized system, and are disgruntle about how unfair the system is, not only about how the electors are chosen but how the larger states have an advantage in votes and in information 
There many explanations on how this land form got there, but there is no evidence that claims it was created by aliens. 
the faces are just nautural land forms and not something supernatural 
If I had a say into which should be used and which should not be used, I would rule in the favor of the popular vote process and not in the favor of the Electoral College process. 
Many people dislike this system including myself. 
i think this is wrong, 
The risks involved with driverless cars are way to high for the potential payoff 
And iv noticed that its unfair 
I think that, policy number one is genius. You should let the students bring there phones during free periods and lunch periods. 
The face on mars is just a natural landform 
This idea of not letting students participate in sports or other activities unless they have a grade B average is just bologna. 
School is a requirement for all children and young adults in the country, so distance learning would be beneficial to any students who are unable to attend. 
Community service is something people do voluntary, not something that should be required. 
I honestly think that student should be required to do community service. 
I think you should allow the students to bring their cell phones because of security reasons. 
Some of the other students and I do not think that it is fair for you to acquire all of the students to do community service without us accepting. 
I strongly support policy 1, which allows students to bring and use their cell phones during school as long as they are turned off in class 
Well on my opinion I don't think the face is a natural landform, 
classroom instruction is more beneficial to students than online classes 
"We, as voters, have a right to be able to vote for whomever we choose; not someone to choose for us. We should change the Electoral College to election by popular vote "
I in my opinion am against having driverless cars 
I think the second policy is better 
"Juding by this artical ""Does the Electoral College Work?"",� readers would agree that electoral colleges should be changed. "
Many students would benefit from attending classes at home. 
I think we should get rid of The Electoral College. 
"If it was up to me to keep the electoral callege system i would say yes but they just have to make some few changes. 
"
"we need to change how our country votes on its leader; we need to use popular vote for the president of the United States "
I honestly think we should chnge the elction by popular vote fot the president of the United States 
I believe that we should change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America 
Just like the Google cofounder Sergey Brin, I too also visualize a future where cars just aren't much of a use to the world much anymore. 
It is a bad idea, they should not make cars driveless 
Dear State Senator, I propose that we change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States rather than having the Electoral College. 
It has been made clear that we should not change the Electoral College 
I think you should allow students to bring their phones to school and use them during study halls and lunch periods 
"It is a natural landform just like it would be on our home planet of Earth. Although some conspiracy theorists say differently, and think that is some sort of ancient civilization building these objects. 
"
It's not right to have a few people have just as big of a say as hundreds of thousands of people. 
The electoral college needs to be abolished for the sake of our citizens. We would all benefit from changing the voting system to Popular Vote, on voting for the president of the United States 
Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home for many reasons 
Well we can't be forced to do community service if we don't have to, volunteering is just fine. 
"Driverless cars are the next step in automotive technology and the research on them should continue because they will be safer and more efficient than cars driven by human drivers. 
"
Not many notice how electoral college is important even it has some flaws. This voting system is a great way to determine the final results to see who becomes the president. 
I believe that we should go with the popular vote method 
I say we get dispose of it and change the election to most popular vote! That way we also have a say on who is going to be the new President and the new Vice President. For we also have to have a say on this. 
I think that we should leave it the way it is now and keep our sports teams, academic teams, and school clubs the way they're supposed to be with every member remaining on that specific group, club, team, or whatever you wish to call it. 
I believe you should make a policy that allows anyone with a C grade average or higher allowed to participate in sports and other activities. If they have a D or F grade average, then I agree that they should spend more of their time working on school work so they don't fail, but why make the students be above average just to participate in something besides school? I have three important reasons for pressing the matter. 
I do not think there are alien's in Mars or any other planet . 
This example leads me to believe that policy one is the better choice because teens, and children should be allowed to have their cell phones out at free times such as study hall, lunch and after school hours. 
I think the Electoral college is a good way to vote for the president or vice president 
I think the policy best suited for our school would be the first policy. 
I take your position in thinking to require every student to perform community service. 
Me being a young teenager and only being in highschool, I feel as if we should keep the Electoral College. 
Through out the world a lot of people are excited about the driverless cars that are being developed. However some of them fail to realize the negativities that come with this package. 
"
Despite their obvious dependence on them, teenagers are often banned from having phones in school. Although I could understand some concern, I believe this should not be the case at any school. "
I believe that the electoral college should not be kept because it is an unfair system of voting. There are flaws in the electoral college system that make it an unfair system to choose our president. 
After doing some background research on the theme of the electoral college, i have realized that this system is wrong and should be changed 
NASA scientist dont believe that this was alien trying to send a signal or a message to us for all we know a astroid may hit mars and we didnt know. 
i think you should just keep it the same 
I, as a scientist disagree about what many people think it is. I personally think its just a regular natural landmark in Mars. 
"Driverless will be safe to drive on the roads even without a driver. 
"
That is why i disagree/ dislike the fact to have a computer drive you. 
"I actually find that to be a wonderful idea. I mean just think about it usually students don't care, they just think ""Oh, Well I can play Football with whatever grades I might get."" Well If you make that brand new school policy you might see an extraordinary change in the grades for kids. "
To be honest we should not keep the Electoral College because there unfair, outdated, and irrational. There unfair to citizens and the states who vote 
You should require all students to perform community service 
After reading this story/argument i think we should remove the Electoral college, 
abolishing the electoral college could only be beneficial to us. 
"This is my opinion of your future change in the school activities. I'm not in favor in this change, if the students are good players, the principal have to let they play at least they have a grade C average, but if the students don't have a good grade, like F or D, the principal have to tell they that they can't play anymore, till they make a good grade. 
"
The electotral college doesnt work in my opinion 
Im agree with the Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President. 
I don't think it is right that you need to have a b average because some people cant mentally and fiskley do it . 
My opinion would have to be Policy 2 
Students should require to do this service 
Dear, state senator I think changing elections by popular vote for the president of the United States would be better. 
Distance learning would be a massive benefit to students 
I don't believe that anyone wants constant problems when choosing a leader. To avoids all of the problems why not take the Electoral College out overall 
we should get rid of the Electoral College for many reasons. 
I was meaning to ask you can you please leave the electoral college. 
I believe that the Electoral College should stay in process 
The students is not a god idea to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because some students copies a test in home or use a internet for a project or something like that 
I would agree with keeping the Electoral College because its a fair way to elect the president of the united states. 
I am against driverless cars for many reasons. 
In my sight community service is essential. 
"While the details and positive benefits these ""Driveless Cars"" may sound great but the neagatives can also affect people. And the negatives can also put someone in the chance of danger .    "
I'm not going to keep it because its not a good idea and people want to vote for who they want and not vote just so someone can pick who they want like their choice didn't matter. 
We need to keep the electoral college because it serves so many purposes in the united states. 
It's and natural landform beacause it could of been caused from a piece of another planet branching of and crashing, or regular elements acting apon the planet itself. 
In all honesty, if it were up to me, I would keep the Electoral College 
Driverless cars are the transportation system of the future. Their benefits greatly outweigh those of the current system. 
I think that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. 
I think that the electoral college should stay 
"I beleive that we should throw out the electoral colledge and not use it anymore. Today it is irrelevant and it does not help out the elections, in fact I think it only causes trouble. 
"
"I believe that development and research for the creation of truly automatic transportation should be continued, based on information from ""Driverless Cars Are Coming: "
I've heard about the changes you want to make and I have a lot of suggestion on it 
it is good that all student should perform in community service 
The electoral college should be abolished 
I do think that students should be required to do community service. 
Cars that drive them selves shouldn't be developed. 
We should have electoral collage 
My opinion on the policy is to not have cell phones out at all. I have a couple of ways to back up my opinion. 
Personally I believe that Electoral Colleges work 
Dear principal i think that you should be able to bring your cell phones to school 
I think the face is a natural landform. 
The Electoral College should be kept. It has been like this for a lot of years so why change it now? 
I think students must have a least a B average to participate in sports. 
Well, I dont think that it is right, and there are some reasons I am about to tell you that may change your mind about the whole process of voteing and electing a president. 
I feel that we should keep the Electoral College 
I think it should be a requirement to all students to take up some type of community service. 
"On my opinion the Electoral Vote should be changed in order for people to vote for the president they want. 
"
i think we should be allow to 
The senator should keep the Electoral Collage 
I think we should get rid of the Electoral Collage vote. 
"However, the electoral college is flat out taking away our right to share our thoughts about the future leaders of the nation. The electoral college is irrational, and unfair. 
"
it is not an alien created object 
I think that having electorals college is a great idea for our counries 
Hello my name is Generic_Name and I am here to tell you why I think, distance learning is a good idea, rather then a bad idea 
I would keep the Electoral College because it consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where�they vote for president and Vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. 
"Well, it just appears to be a natural formation rather than something that was created."" "
we should keep the electoral college process. 
"In my opinion students should not be required to do community service but every few weeks we should have a sign-up sheet for a certain service that people may participate in. 
"
I whole-heartedly believe if we leave the responability to chose our president in the magority vote that this country will become more unstable than it already it 
I say that students should not be required to perform community service but make it like a extra credit thing to earn extra credits. 
I� belive that my state senator should remove the electoral colleges. To change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. 
I know us children tend to be lazy at times, but we should be more active in community service and these are the reasons why. 
I think we should have the students only have to do community service two or three times a week 
i don't agree with having a high grade ''B'' to be able to play sports, because many people like playing sports like me and well i don't think its far. 
There are many things that could go wrong with the way we the United states are voting now which is why we should use election by popular vote. 
I strongly feel that we should change from Electoral College to election by popular vote. 
I believe that a B average would be a good thing to bring into sports. 
I think that yes, our school should participate in community service such as picking up litter and helping out elders and elementary children. 
I believe that human driven cars will soon be a thing of the past, and that the development of these new vehicles will be the new normal. 
I think that students should be required to do community service. 
it should be known that students would not benefit from attending classes at home because of many great reasoning. 
Today I would like to point out why we should keep with the program Electoral College. 
The goverment uses a system of elctoral votes well i dont think we should during the presidential election 
The Electoral College provides different opportunities for other political members as well by the common people. 
the driverless cars should be developed and permited for use on public roads. 
Driverless cars would be a good idea 
I believe your second policy on cell phones is the best choice. From being a student and experiencing what students do, your second policy is the right choice 
Some students woul benefit from being able to attend classes from home, but just those who�really need it, like students with disability or health problems 
so I think you need to do good in school to play or do school. stuff 
eletoral college can be a very good thing cause it can mean also picking other electors. this can help us and our state alot. 
I think that they should do voting by the popular vote 
Electoral college should be changed to election by popular vote for the president. 
Driverless cars are coming soon and has been used before, these will soon be able to help us and change the world, they will soon change the way we look at cars today. 
driverless cars seem like a waste of money and time. 
The Electoral College is not only more efficiant but it lets the citizens keep their votes as well. 
they need to keep the most popular one by elections because it would be fair to people to have the electoral votes. 
I think that it isn't right to change the school policy because some students cant pull there grade up to a B or higher. 
I think kids should not have to do community service 
I believe that the Electoral College should be kept in the presidential elections, 
In my opinion, it should be by the electorial college. 
I beleive that students will benefit in many ways from more schools offering distance learning as an option to attand class from home. 
We should keep the elcetoral college 
So i belive that electoral college should be at most the most effecient way of electing a president 
it has become apparent to me that some kids are not on board with the idea of it and think its to much work for to little pay-out. How-ever I do not agree with them 
I will give my personal opinions on why the Electoral College should be kept. 
I Think its a great idea for us to start doing community service 
"I think that students of SCHOOL_NAME should be aloud to use their cell phones during lunch and other free times, just as long as the phones are turned off during class. 
"
One of the best things about the Electoral College is that it's widely regarded as an anachronism and a non-democratic method of the selecting of a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes wins. 
In my opinion im against driverless cars 
"To prove to my fellow collegues about the ""Face on Mars"" thing was naturally made, not by alien lifeforms, i have decided to write this paper. "
Driverless cars could potentially help but often after time machines have been proved to fail or later experience problems. 
It is a natural landformation and is visible 
My position on driverless cars is, that they wont be as safe as cars driven by humans. 
A process that seems meaningless, a process that is uncalled for. 
I don't think it's the best idea to choose this method despite it being a more simple process but using the popular vote method sounds more fair,source two also says that someone won the popular vote but the electoral college prevented him from becoming the next president 
"i have to say. the electoral college sounds like a really bad idea! 
"
Not everyone can do homeschooling, 
Dear Senator: I'am writing you this letter to inform you that I argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. Why? 
Well, I think all the students from fifth grade and up should take on the responsibility of doing community service for their school 
I do not believe it is right that you should change the grade average to participate in sports. 
In my opinion aliens arent real and they didnt put this face on mars why cant people do research just to figure out if aliens are capable of doing these things. I honestly dont think that aliens would do this. just because i actually dont believe that they are real. So thats why im here to change anyones opinion about this face on mars. 
The Face was made by natural landform not created by aliens. 
community service should not be required in school, 
You should go with policy number one because students should have time to use their cell phones during school but not during class time. 
As important as community service is, I do not believe it should be mandatory 
To state senator i'm argue is that we should keep the Electoral College 
The Electoral college is corrupt and needs to go away. 
I think its an wonderfuk idea. 
Welll its going to be ah good beefit but in the same time it's a bad benefit to doing class in the house . 
It is imperative that people abandon their old fashioned ideas about technology and school and recognize the benefits that online school may provide. Distance learning and online school would benefit students and schools 
I think that allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are off or on silent during class time is a great idea 
Are electoral college better than other colleges. yes i belive that a electoral college is better than other collages 
Have an online school/classes would beneficial to many students. 
Driverless cars are not a good idea at all. 
I thing that no matter what student need to do they should help out in cleaning the world because it is out good to live in a nasty world. 
I think that students that have a C average should at least have an extra class that they need help in so they can pull up their grades up so the students can participate in sports or activities. 
In short, distance learning is beneficial to students in public schools for students missing school 
The electoral college was established to help the election proces run smoothly and it has worked for decades without any major flukes or flaws. So why change now? 
I want to change the election by popular votes instead of the Electoral College 
"Some students believe that we should have community service some disagree. I am about show why some disagree and some agree. 
"
I think that having cell phones at lunch periods and at other free times such as locker break would be better in ways 
If I were to choose between keeping the electoral college or abolishing it, I would chose for abolishing it. 
I personally think that policy 1, the one when kids are allowed to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch and free periods but must be turned off during class, is the right one. 
I think that the Electoral College is important becase it is� a process. 
with all do respect I want to tell you why you shouldn't require all students to perform community service. 
It was never a sign that aliens were on Mars

Policy 1 is a great idea cause students would be able response to there messages during lunch time and will also be able to use it when they have free time in class 
The negitive side on the outher hand, yes we should not have cars that dirve without human control. 
I fell that you should require every student to do some sort of community service. 
At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters.

The facewas just a natural landform.

Dear principal I think policy number 1 is better than policy number 2

"The Electoral College should not be used. 
"
I do not think community service should be required but it can be an extra-curricular activity 
I would like to argue that we should change to doing the election by popular votes not by the Electoral College. It is unfair to but the pressure of picking the right candidate on the Electoral College. 
To me the country has it all wrong, I think we as US citizens should let our votes decide on who should be president. Even though things may get done quicker I think everyones voice should be heard. 
The natural landform was not made by any kind of alien in Mars. It is just a landform that appended to look like a human face.

"
I personally think that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

I find it very unfair that students are not allowed to participate in school sports or other activities with a C average. 
So we decided to show it to the world because it was just a mesa. 
Although the Electoral College should be abolished for there dispicable disision making,there just choosing a way to get a better prisident. 
The electoral college is not a good idea. 
Policy 1 I believe is better because as long as the students turn the cell phones off during class time it would be fine. 
I am writing this letter to inform you that requiring all students to perform community service is a great idea 
Driverless cars are a great investment and idea for our country to encourage. 
"The futuristic automobiles could revolutionize the country. Drivereless cars are a fantastic idea, and could create several benifits for the country. 
"
"
I believe the way the American Goverment is run is injust and outdated. I believe this because the way we as America elect a new president is unfair to many people. "
We have gone on long enough with the electoral college, it is outdated and inefficient. 
I strongly believe that students should get to have a C average to work in sports or other activities. 
The Electoral college is unnecesary 
Electrical cars are coming, and you won't want to miss it. 
The electoral college keeps a balance in a country, a balance very much needed. I agree with it one hundred percent. 
The policy i believe is better is policy one 
I believe that cell phones should not be allowed at school whatsoever. 
I think community service should be something everyone does to help others, or to help the Earth. 
Your first policy sounds great 
It is time we change things and move to a election by popular vote. 
"""I say we change!"" Changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States can be a way better idea to do than keeping the Electoral college. "
I think that raising the required grade for sports from a C to a B will inspire students to work harder for their grades and since they won't be distracted by sports it will be much more achievable. 
I think that we should change over to election by popular vote 
i think the kids at school should have there phones just when they need them like if something goes wrong maybe they will need to call for help so that's what i thing we need to change at to keep kids safe. 
we should do Electoral College 
I think as a citizen of Flordia that the Electoral College should not be apart of our states voting rights because the people voteing do not have a direct vote to the president. 
taking classes online could be tremendously beneficial in the daily life of a student, 
I would say I am against dirivless cars. Why not use cars that we can drive ourselves? Are Drivless cars actually the safest? 
students are require to take community service 
It might be fun, it might be cool, but is it's not safe. Not only would driverless cars be dangerous themselves 
I think we should have a club in doing so for many reasons. 
no i'm not in favor of keeping the Electoral College 
i think that students should have cell phones at passing time and lunch time 
I think students should be able to use there phones at school just not in class . Like in Policy 1 
driverless cars are a good idea 
i am completely convinced that the electoral collage is no longer necessary. 
I think that bring your phone to school and using them at lunch, break and other free times is a good idea. 
Community Service is a really good way to help from polluting the earth. 
Me personaly think that cars should not be produce by conpanyes 
"I'm not saying you should let us have it out during class, but in between class periods or during lunch. It would be a big help to us and you. By that I mean our education. 
"
The electoral college should be kept in use 
I believe the best decision is to change to an election by popular vote for the President of the United States. 
"On the matter of ""driverless cars"", I would advocate for their developement. "
But I have reason to say that students should be able to have use in there phone during lunch periods and other free times but yet to have it off during class. 
Giving students that option would benefit them a lot. 
Students should not be required to perform community service in order to pass a class or grade. Community service should not be a requirement, 
the Electoral College is very helpful and is needed more than people think. 
I think students should have to do community service 
and although this would be good in some ways this would be worse for many reasons 
I consider that policy 1 is above par because of numerous reasons.

The face on Mars is probaly naturally made 
I want to take the time to speak my mind and said whats wrong with the clectoral college.� 
I am writing to you to argue in favor of changing the Electoral vote to election by popular vote for the president of the United States 
"You seriously need to change this whole ""Electoral College"" voting system. It's not right and not accurate. Wouldn't it be fair if the people had a say in this? We..The People? "
I personally don't think it is a very good idea to make it where kids with C average grades cant play sports and do other activities they like after school. 
This year I would like to see only the Electoral College vote for the president 
So I have came to give you my opinion on what we should do, and that is, policy 1. To me policy 1 is better 
Everyone needs to help change the world, and I agree that community service is a big deed that students should be taking a part of, 
"Students should be able to use their cell phones in school during any free time they have as long as they are not using them in class; during which time the phones should be turned off. "
Students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at�home 
i think that driverless cars would be a waste of time because you'll still have to be alert, they'll puit camera's in your car and people shouldn't be texting and driving anyway, 
I will assure you that it was just a natural landform. 
The Electoral College is a flawed system used to elect presidents, and the American voting system should be based on popular vote 
"Electoral Colleges are very important and should be in every ""state"" "
The Electoral College is a very useful and easy was of voting. 
The electoral college is not a good thing and it certainly messes things up 
For my own opinion , I think most students that have problems at school should take online or video classes at home to make it easier for them to learn and study. 
"I'm started to believe that changing the electoral votes to popular votes would be better for elections of presidents. 
"
I think you should keep the electoral colleges. 
It just so happens its not actually a face. Scientists discovered that the face on mars was just a natural landform. 
i would rather change to voting for most popular president in the united states and the electoral college is simply to complicated 
Their are alot of dicusions on wether we should get rid of an electoral college. But i think we should keep them for five reason 
To solve the problem in a way that is pleasing to both sides, I propose to you a compromise. If a student keeps a grade average of an A, community service will be optional. If a student's grades fall below that, community service will be a requirement. 
8th students should be able to use cell phones during our free time as long as the teacher allows it. 
My position on this subject is the students should have the choice to do community service or not, they shouldn't be required to do. 
I feel it should be up to the people of the united states not all up to the electors. 
I will go ahead and start by telling you that taking away cell phones all together will only cause misery and sorrow for all. It is my suggestion and that of the school that you would allow us to have our phones available for use in our free time and lunch periods. 
Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home through video conferencing and other forms of distance learning. 
If this great country of ours is a democracy, shouldnt be the president decided by the people for the people. 
state senator i am writing this letter to argue in favor of keeping the electoral college and changing to election by polulor vote for the president of the united states.

I believe we should abolish it completely. I believe that we should change our voting system to election by popular vote for the president of the United Sates. 
But, people who agree with NASA know it is actually just a mesa. 
I think the electoral college should be changed and people old enough to vote should be able to chhose who they want to be president 
I think that every student should do community service. 
Hoping for a mere 538 people to vote for our nations president seems like an unfair way of voting 
The electoral college system is a mock of the American people and an outdated idea that does not fit in with our current state as a whole. 
I don't think its Aliens, it has to be the way the land formed its self. 
Students would benefit from being able to attend or complete a class from home 
Students should not be required to perform community service. 
I think your idea of allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phone are turned off during class time, might be the best or possible policy 
we should keep the Electoral college. 
Scientist Rafael, There's no way it was created by aliens, I think it was just a natural landform 
This policy is unreasonable 
"Well I'm here to prove to you its not.

Here are my three examples that prove that its just a mesa "
yes 
When getting down to the nitty-gritty bits of the Electoral College voting system it is a bit unfair in the ways it works in a whole, but that doesnt mean we have to abolish it and start over. 
Students wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they would take advantage, start on their own time, and they wouldn't understand the lesson. 
I think that the Face they saw in 1976 was just a natural landform 
I think that policy 1 is the best choice. I think this because that's what all students from school need cell phones. 
I think that the head was form by itself when the heat from Mars rise and it burn some of the rock and form the big head. I don't think it was made by alien because if they were in Mars they would burn when the sun come or when the heat rise from Mars 
The school should do community service on their community 
The Electoral College does infact work for most states in USA minus Nebraska and maine. The santor should keep the Electoral College to keep the presidents and vice presidents intact 
This face is just a natural landform 
but I believe that community service will be a value to our education and should be required by your school 
Therefore, I believe that community service should be required for students at school not everyday, but at least maybe twice a week. 
is time we move on from it. 
We have to save the electoral college 
Dear state senator i really think we should keep the electoral college. I mean look at how far we have come in are lives were we have kept this system working for years and it has not faild us yet 
The flawed Electoral College must be abolished and replaced with election by popular vote in order to ensure the well being of our country. 
Hi my names Kaigen and I am against the idea of self driving vehicles. 
I believe strongly that we should keep the electoral college, 
Driverless cars are the future of transportation. These types of cars will allow for the easy transportation of people without the need to take accout for human fatigue. 
we should not keep the Electoral College and change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. 
I think it is safe to say that the face on Mars is just a natrual landform 
The president of the United States should be decided by the Electoral College process, not by most popular vote. There are many reasons why we should keep the way we vote the same. 
It is clear that we need to bring the Electoral College back. 
I believe that keeping the Electoral College is the best way to vote. 
There is nothing wrong with the Electoral College, it is just the ones that run it. So if there should be any change, it should be the government that should change, not the Electoral College! 
I have to say I do not agree on this possible policy change. I believe children who have grades below a B average should still be able to participate in school sports and other activities. 
I beleive that we should keep the electoral college. 
Im here to tell you all the information you need to see what your opinion of this topic is 
After much research, I have decided that the electoral college should not be kept.

if you can change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States

I PROPER_NAME think that the electoral college should be Abolished . 
the electoral collage is a process that helps use vote for the preaident and vice president. and they count the electores votes and it is desited by congress. 
Based on my research, The Electoral College should stay and should be used everytime in an election for President. 
For some students, this policy is outrageous and should be thrown out of consideration, for others such as myself, we believe that it is fully justified and would help drive students to achieve higher grades so that they may continue to participate in their sport. 
Developing driveless cars could make driving easier but is a neagtive thing 
I think that the United States shouldn't have the Electoral College and should just have a president win by the most votes. This is truly the best way to choose a president. I seriously don't like the idea about Electoral College and I think that the U.S should change that. 
I think students should not perform community service 
we shouldnt keep the Electoral Collage. 
i argue in favor of keeping� the electoral votes alive to choose for the new turn 
I think people with a c average should be able to play sports just like people who have a b. 
Community service is a great opportunity to help others. 
i belive we should�trash the electoral college and do popular votes. 
Having the election by popular vote has benifited our community in various ways 
The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. 
Most would say that the Electoral College is reguarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic way of selecting a president. Like every other thing in the world, people form their own opinions. There are pros and cons to everything, even the Electoral College. 
I believe that this could be a good decision but may also be a bad one as well. 
I believe that the Electoral College vote should be abolished 
The picture that was taken in 2001 clearly showed that The Face was no longer there,

I would like to change the election for the president of the United States. I would like to vote for president myself and not for a slate of electors because then I can't really control who the electors vote for. 
I think kids do home classes and it does benefits them and yes they learn from it . 
It must be changed to meet the needs of giving a responisble president, a more trustworthy election and the votes cast must be directly towards him rather than the electors. In other words, the Electoral College must be changed to become more fair towards the citizens. 
This is why I argue in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states. 
I believe that community service is extremely important and that all students should be required to perform some community service. 
This face is not because of aliens it was just a landform. 
Students should be able to have cell phones at school

I would keep it the same 
I think they should go by popular vote 
I�think you should keep the�Electoral�College because its a process that consist of the selection of the electors. 
My opinion is there should be no need for electors. It should be easy and not too complicated. A presdient, a vice president, and a secatary. No electors or nothing. 
I think it would be bad to have community service 
I think that students should all have to do some community service. 
The Face on Mars is just a landmark. 
i think it could be is that a rock may crash into mars and made the face

I believe we should change the election process. You should change it to an election of popular vote and give the people power to decide not on the electors for the candidates, but just on the candidates themselves. 
Changing the school policy to only letting students attend or play sports is good but bad at the same time 
To further empower the citizens of the United States the Electoral Colleges should be abolished.

i want electoral college to stay 
You see, not only is the Electoral College unfair, but it also creates a lie that tricks everyone into believeing that our President was the one that the majority of America voted for, when that is not always the case. 
I don't think students of any school should have to do community service if they don't want to. 
The students should be required perform community. This is because, the students will need to know about their community and what goes on. 
"If we change our voting system we can vote for our leader rather than us voting for the slate of electors, and have the most popular leader of our country be our president. 
"
To begin with, Having the electoral congress is a great idea, 
No,The Face on Mars is just a natural lanform 
I would like to change the Electoral College to the popular vote for the President of the United States 
I think that every person who wants to go for president should go to electoral school, just so when ever the person runs for president they don't win because they are well known and popular vs the other person who is not well known. 
I think we shouldn't have our phones during school hours. I think we should be aloud to use it after school or before school, but once you enter the school there should be a policy for NO CELL PHONES 
They should change it to election by popular vote 
This way of election for a president is unfair and confusing and should be changed. 
I think students at this school should have to be able to put on a community service task. It would be helping the school and the community a lot. The world has been very dirty from people littering and not caring about the environment around them 
"a natural landform there was no landform . there was no alien monument after all. 
"

electing by the Elector College is way better than voting by the popular vote inthe United States 
I believe that we should keep Electoral Colleges but massive changes to the system. 
I think that the Electoral College should be abolished and to elect a president by popular vote. 
The things that go on in florida about keeping in electorial college is working for us there are good reasons and bad reason where to keep it or change it to popular vote. 
I deserve to be able to pick the president i want, or at least have my vote be the reason the president i was rooting for wins.

Clearly, students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home 
There are three reasons why it is� important to keep the method of an electoral colledge. 
My position on driverless cars is that I'm really not a big fan of the idea so I don't really aprove of it 
lets try and keep the electoral college. These are the facts that willmake want to vote against the popularity vote for presdency. 
"I believe that we shouldn't change the Electoral College ""winner takes all"" system "
I don't think the students would get benefits from being able to attend clasess from home. 
The idea of driverless cars is a great idea because the environment will benefit from it greatly and human error on the roads will become a thing of the past. 
"The current Electoral College is working fine, this is one of the reasons it shouldn't change but there are more reasons as to why it shouldn't change.

The current Electoral College has worked greatly to our nation even though people don't see it that way but it has. "
Schools offering online classes to students would be a grand benefit to all students, and could make a profound impact on their learning and their grades. 
I think that the electoral collage is vary unfair to voters as would most people if they knew they where voting for voters to vote for the president. 
"Yes, in my opinion, Electoral College is a good idea.

In the cases of having an Electoral College there are some up sides of this and some down sides. "
the electoral college that is. it changes the way we elect our president,and a lot of people don't like that,me being one,and i think we need to just have a straight forward election. 
Schools should offer fully online learning to students 
i think for students the academic level for sports should be a B or higher 
Popular vote is the way that the presidential voting should be because, of the fact that peoples votes arent actually making a difference in who is to become president of the untited staes of america. 
I think that we should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. 
Students like me prefer more stuff like sports better food and other stuff but if we don't do good in school we don't deserve nothing like that. 
You should keep the Electoral College because the founding fathers of the United States Of America established it when they made the constitiution. 
I believe this is a natural landform for many reasons 
it might not be as well thought out and fair as we thought. 
"But is letting the machine take over most of the time really the best option? Could it lead to even more problems than it hopes to fix? These questions have yet to be answered and need to be. 
"
I believe that yes we should keep the electoral college. To take it away would be wrong to me i have many reasons why and pay attention to find out why i believe we should keep the electoral college. 
my opnion is I believed that is the smart way to make people life more easier, But it will make people to be lazy to drive. 
For me, Policy 1 is better, base from my own opinion. Because Policy 1 would be better from Policy 2 
The electoral college is very unfair. 
Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by online schooling 
the Face was just a natural landform 
"I would like to express my opininioun on keeping existance to the Electoral Collage. 
"
I think it is best to keep the Electoral college 
The Electoral College process should be kept because of its many purposes and the fact that it was established for a reason 
I think community service is a very important requirement to have in schools. We all live in a community, so we all need to work as a community. 
I don't think it is necesary for any one. 
the electoral college has many reasons why we should keep it. 
Senator i argue that the state shouald change the system to change the election by popular vote. 
I disagree to have the new policy that students may not participate in sports or any other activities unless they have at least a B average grade. 
Students should not have to have at least a grade B average to participate in sports 
Many schools have a policy that students must obtain at least a D average which is barely passing. I don't think that this should be so. Although I don't think that the policy at our school should be changed to obtaining a B average either. 
i argue in favor of the electoral college. 
The change from the Electorial College would be more favorable by the citzens in Florida even in the country because it gives more of a comfort knowing that the election is a 50/50. 
I think you should let the students decide whether we should be required or not be required to do community service. 
Accoding to the text its a natural landfrom 
"The real fact is that the face on Mars is just a natural landform. 
"
While the idea is good, the execution of it can show a negative outcome. Students will show better academic growth in a physical class, 
We shouldnt keep the Electoral College 
Using online learning for a teaching method would be very useful 
I would argue in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states and not keeping the ellectoral college. 
I believe that the cell phone policy should be allowed in school but for school use only 
I think electoral collage is is a stupid process and is definitly outdated. 
I believe should change the vote of the Electoral College into a popular-based vote. 
I feel like it would be a great idea to have Driverless Cars 
The reason for this paper is that i would like to, participate in anything that is required to do. 
They may not be the best idea right now but in the next decade or so will be obsolute . 
Community service is a great thing to do for the environment. 
it would be a good thing not to really use a cell phone but to be able to have it just in case let me tell you why. 
I would want to keep the Electoral College 
I could not� imagine if we were to ever et rid of the electoral college that has been there since our founding fathers. 
I think we should keep the Electoral College. 
"But I am here to explain why it wasn't created by aliens. 
"
i feel like you should keep the electoral college 
The Electoral College is a ominous process, 
I believe the electoral college should be taken away from the process. 
I think that you should let kids play sports even if there grade is lower than a B average. There are people that need help and it is not fair to them if they are having trouble. There are three reasons why you should let students play sports without a B average. 
These are the reasons why i think that the electoral college does not work. Anymore in todays modern times where it is all out dated.    
I think that if the policy stays the same then the students, you, the school, and the district will benefit from our curriculum and sport life. 
I think they should keep the Electoral college 
I disagree with the fact of having a Electoral College. I don't think it would help with the elections. I think it should go the most popular votes. 
Well let me tell you, they didn't. It resembles traits of natural landforms that we on the Earth have too. 
I think that yes if there was driverless cars that not just a couple people should have them everyone should 
I think that community service is a great way to keep our planet clean. 
In my opinoin I think we should absolutely keep the Electoral College system. 
My oppinon on driverless cars is that i dont like it. 
In my opinion, driverless cars are a good idea. 
Students should do community service, but community service should be done due to the goodness of someone's heart, not due to the force of someone's hand. 
The electoral college may seem like its a good idea to keep thngs going,but I think America should get rid of it. 
I support the policy change of requiring students to have at least an average grade of a B in order to play sports or participate in other activities 
I personally think that we should not have the Electoral College , because the citizens should be allowe to pick our president and vice prsident. It should be up to the people not the congress. 
"""i think that the principal have to considering allow student to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time "
Well first off, i dont really care if they are made or not, it's not my money or time being invested or devoted into them. Now i wouldnt say they are a good idea, but i will say i think they are a really cool project and concept, and i do and know they are out there. 
I think the face on mars is a land form 
Thats why some people think its just best to do school online in stead of in person 
Most people are with the fact that we vote for Electoral College but unfortuntley , im not. I am in favor to change to Election by popular vote for the President of the United States. 
I believe that we should change the election to the most popular vote instead of keeping the electorial college . The Electoral College was a good idea proposed by the Founding Fauthers , But i believe that it is time to kind of switch it up. 
I think we should keep the electoral college 
. It could all just be a natural landform that looks like a face. 
I think we should just have only a C or above to be able to go out for sports or other activities. 
We need to go with Bob Doyle accusation of that we need to abolish the Electoral College 
Electoral College doesn't really prove anything because some people won votes and lost the presidency,thanks to electoral college. 
Community work never hurts, Its something that would be good for our school. 
therefore i am here to inform you why Electoral College shouldnt be kept and popular vote should win 
The Electoral College is one of the most fair systems our society has set up 
This response will side with the argument of being against driverless cars 
The face on Mars was actually landform on mars and not a face 
I am certain that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. 
if the time you require is more than six hours a week, I oppose the decision to make it an obligation. I do not think that students should be made to do this. 
Is this who we really vote for, and is it fair? This should be eradicated. 
I would agree with Policy One. 
a more options for estudent that cant go to school on morning they can go on the asfer nuon or they can home classes or vidio confedensil. 
Dear senator The Electoral College process should be changed 
electoral college should not be changed to election. 
I believe the Electoral College should be diminished. 
I am in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the election of the president of the United States. Over sixty percent of voters prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. I believe this change would make electing a president much more simple 
My argument for the development of the driverless cars is that we should have them. 
I do not think that students should be required to perform community service. I do think that it should be highly recommended though. 
"
As a student's perspective I think that the school board shouldn't have any cell phones allowed at all. "
Students would not benefit from taking online classes from home 
Though it would be a big step, it would not be a step in the right direction. 
"so the answer to that question would be yes it does work because it gives the people a right to choose who they want and the president doesn't get to much power and without this system we wouldn't have any presidents you know what i mean. 
"
Why do we need such an abomination for voting, when we can all vote for the person we want to win the election not, just some group of electors Democratic or Republican so they can vote for us 
im definitely going with policy one 
"Just my opion on them is that its a good idea and I would love to experince riding one. 
"
The Electoral College has many amazing things people like about using it .When it comes to voting not many people do 
yeah ot would be cool to have a couple driverless cars in the country but not to make multipule 
If you ask me, this strange looking thing is just a natural landform. 
The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votesthe winner. 
I think you should use policy 1 for several reasons. 
Agreed that it is unfair something like the Electoral College to be around especially in this era, it craves more rights than it feels it's been restricted from 
"Many companies have been working on the idea of ""driverless cars"" in hopes that they will reshape the whole concept of driving. However, that does not mean they are a good thing. Driverless cars should not be used in the future "
I think that we should keep the Electoral College but we could also change election by popular vote 
Our country would be much better off if we kept the electoral college, rather than choosing the president just based on the popular vote. 
I think all students need to attend school to have better opportunities and better skills on learning. 
These cars are very fesable 
The Face is an actual landform, it was not created by aliens. 
I think cars should still be famous in the future so we could make new cars. 
Electoral votes is what we need but some disagree 
Video Conferencing is not very advisable and great 
The face on mars have to be a alien 
I think that u must have at least a B average to play a sport or activity is a bad rule 
If you are sane at all, you would not allow cell phones. 
Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home 
There is no need to change the school's policy so that students with a B average or above may be the only ones aloud to participate in sports and other school activities. Granted, students must keep up with their school work, but level of book smarts does not effect the qualities for sports or other activities. 
i don't think that the faces were created by aliens 
"It's just a rock, a plain, thousands of years old, heap of rock. The End, no ""Ifs, ands, or buts"", there is evidence saying that this is just a mesa, a landform, we have picture proof of it. "
I think we should ge rid of it because if people vote for a preident and then they dont get what they want there gonna get mad and revolt aginsit the government 
I strongly suggest you on changing to election by popular vote and getting rid of the Electoral College 
"What i have discoved is when you are taking classes at school your diverse yourself better that at home, or online. 
"
Yes i do think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home 
I think you should let us bring cell phones to school at longest they're turned off, and letting us using them on the hallways, lunch, and at the gym 
I agree with the change in the policy. Maintaining a grade B average should not be too hard if you have a C average at the time. 
They do not realize that if there is no Electoral College, the people with education will vote to directly decide the president, but so will the uneducated people. 
We should abolish the Electoral College 
Home school is a benefit that anybody could have. 
I belive that Electoral college is unfair in many ways, and maybe it would be good to keep the election by popular vote for the United States 
I most likely disagree that the students and I must maintain a B or higher average to participate in gym and other activities. 
I am against this because I belive it would create many arguments and I belive we are not ready for this yet. 
I think community service is a very good and helpful thing for the community, but I do not think students should be required to do community service. 
"Although many people think that the ""Face on Mars"" was created by aliens, I believe that it's just a landform. "
it would be very beneficial for our school to participate in community service 
The b average requirement should not be revised. These extracurricular activities should only be allowed for the students who try the hardest in their classes. 
Many students might have a' C 'as an overall average, but taking away sports isn't really fair, 
I think we shouldn't do community service 
I think policy 1 is the right policy because three reasons 
I think community service is a great idea for kids here at our school to participate in. 
the electoral college most be important that makes the people to chose what do they want 
I think its unfair to mandate community service. 
It is my belief that it would be in the best interest of all the students and teachers if no cell phones where allowed during school hours under normal circumstances. 
"I Think Policy 1 Is Better Than Policy 2 Because phones Are Useful for Everyone. 
"
I think,that the electoral college should I will tell you right now. The electoral college helps us to avoid problems. So If there is no electoral college we will have problems and I dont want that in our country. 
To have kids take community service is good for the world and it should be required to do community service 
we know that is was now created by aliens 
This was good and efficient for that time, but, with the technology available to us today, it is impractical and easy to corrupt. 
I believe that you should select your first policy 
The Electorial Collage should continue on as a way of electing for various resons with this in play 
Sel driving cars in theory sound like a good idea, but in all reality they aren't. 
I do mostly agree with you. If you really want something, you should try your hardest to aim for it. 
Well I am goingto try and persuade you that the face are a natural land form. 
all i'm trying to say is that it cannot be aliens, it's just a rock on Mars. 
I agree with that, because some student's would not come to the school, this a huge opportunity for us, 
The Electoral College should be kept in use 
There's� five� reasons� for� the Electoral� College. 
driveless cars are not safe 
While we may have had this process for years, it's time for us to take a vote to change the way we vote. Citizens of the United States of America should be able to vote by popular vote 
I believe that cell phones should be allowed in school around free time and at lunch periods. 
Driverless cars are very unecessary and will only cause trouble that can be avoided. 
The Electoral College is a cruel, pointless process that simply makes a percentage of votes, or all of them if you look at it that way, to mean nothing, and allows for circumstances like the 2000 election. 
I along with many other citizens have came to the conclusion that the Electoral College worth keeping. 
The president should be elected by popular vote only. 
One big thing i want to happen is that the electoral college for voting should be changed for popular vote for the prsident because i think that if you change it voting would go a lot easier than it do now. 
In my opinion I believe that students should not do community service for a plethora of ways. 
we should not abolish the Electoral College, 
I believe that schools should allow students to take their phone to school 
"The one that I truly believe would best benefit our school is Policy 2: Not allowing cell phones in school.

This is better than Policy 1 for a number of reasons. 
"
lthough driveless cars are depicted as futuristic and magical, really driveless cars seem like more of an endangerment 
It helps use with our votes. If we lose it certain American citizens votes will not be counted in for the president election 
I think students should be required to perform community service. 
We need to kept the voting process we have now 
My position on diverles cars is that im all for it 
There is actually a myriad of benefits for students that results from them attending classes from home, 
In my opinion, community service is like a thank-you to our environment, neighbors, and government, especially in such a hard economic time. 
There are many people that do no agree with this method. One should be able to put in there vote straight to who wins at an election not send it off to a group of people that one does not know. 
However, if the Electoral College continues to be the nation's way of electing a leader, I'm not so sure I will even have the desire to vote when the time comes. 
Students would definitely benefit from attending online classes 
I have written this letter to you to illistatrate how i disagree this situation with the electoral college 
changing� it from Electroral college to popular is grate idea . 
So when it comes to the president of the United States of America I think we should change it to popular vote.

I believe that all students in school should take part in community service to help out their city, state, maybe even world. Students should at least have one day a week of community service 
I support the developement of driverless/autonomous cars. Cars have been driven by human drivers so far and accidents are frequent and often violent. 
A new system of election must be created to make up for the pitfalls that are inevitable in the Electoral College. A country that is supposed to be a democracy does not have the voting system that such a proud democracy deserves. 
During all of this I have learned that what looks to be a face was actually a landform 
Community service will be an amazing start, with this children will be responsible, grow into a better person, and become great leaders. 
I personally think that for once in a lifetime America and when I say America I mean the people of our nation should be able to elect presidents of the United States by popular votes 
"The Face on Mars is a natural landform. 
"
"So, why keep it if the people don't actually pick the president? 
"
This process doesnt need to make a huge change just some where it can be fair to vote. 
I think that students should do community service 
Students would benefit from being able to take classes from home 
I feel that driverless cars could be both a harm and a help to people. 
I suggest that all students in the school be required to have to do community service. 
You should side with Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and the Chamber of Commerce (Source 2), and abolish the electoral college. 
Although that might be, policy two is much better for many reasons. 
I think that you should not make everyone do community service. 
I think that not all the students should be required to do the community service 
I thank policy one is better 
Personally, I think that the Electoral College has to stay 
With our electoral college, the people of America aren't truly given the right to where their vote matters. 
It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college.    
"you should banned Electoral College votes and approve it by popular votes because it is your people's (persons living in america) lives you are affecting. 
"
I am strongly in favor of keeping the Electoral College 
I disagree with the students attend classes form home or vidoe conferencing 
I dissagree with the idea of the Electoral college 
I think that students would benefit from learning at home
